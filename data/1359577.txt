he will block all attempts to remake or reboot the original film Co writer Bob Gale commented that he did not wish to see another film in the series without the Marty McFly character nor any other actor than Michael J Fox playing him while acknowledging that Fox s current health condition would make this impossible He illustrated this at a fan convention in Florida stating The idea of making another Back to the Future movie without Michael J Fox you know that s like saying I m going to cook you a steak dinner and I m going to hold the beef Gale also said that the Telltale video game adaptation is the closest thing to what a fourth film could be like In an interview on October the day of Marty McFly s purported arrival in the future Christopher Lloyd stated that he would consider making a fourth film under the condition that the original cast and creative team returned along with a story worth telling The same day Lloyd reprised his role as Doc Brown in a brief segment in which the character returns with a special message marking the date In actor Tom Holland claimed in an interview with BBC Radio that he was approached by an unnamed producer over a possible reboot of the franchise with him starring the lead role as Marty McFly or a similarly new character However Holland stated that he was reluctant to take up this offer as he described the existing films as perfect films though he would be interested in re creating scenes from the films in a deep fake homage video or short film Short film Doc Brown Saves the World Doc Brown Saves the World is a direct to video short film starring Christopher Lloyd as Emmett Brown The short debuted on the Blu ray and DVD release of the Back to the Future trilogy commemorating the franchise s th anniversary The short was released on October Emmett Brown is in an undisclosed location outside Hill Valley California He sets a video camera to track his body in order to videotape a message for Marty McFly He explains that it is October one hour before Marty Doc and Jennifer Parker arrive from He explains that when he traveled to the future he discovered that there was a nuclear holocaust that occurred on October He tracked it down to four inventions the food hydrator self lacing shoes the hoverboard and the Mr Fusion home energy reactor The former three inventions led to the world becoming lazy and obese leading to widespread waste The invention of hoverboards led to hovercars which led to people throwing their trash out of the windows causing a great trash storm in All of this trash needed to be disposed of which led to million Mr Fusion units being manufactured All of the Mr Fusion units had a tiny nuclear reactor inside and all of them detonated on October The chain of events that led to this happening began less than twenty four hours after Marty caused Griff Tannen to crash his hoverboard into the Hill Valley Courthouse when Griff was sentenced He vowed to get back at the world for laughing at him and planned to do it through a company that he would found GriffTech Doc holds up a tablet computer with a digital version of the Hill Valley Telegraph On June GriffTech invented a social media network called ThingMeme which secured funding from Douglas J Needles ThingMeme allowed inanimate objects to post selfies on the internet but it was a scam as it allowed Griff to gain access to every object on Earth On the th anniversary of his arrest on October he uploaded a virus that was supposed to flash the word butthead on everything However it short circuited the Mr Fusion network causing nuclear explosions in million homes worldwide Doc Brown travels to an unknown date to ensure these inventions are never created which will prevent the nuclear explosion He leaves his camera on which captures the inventions being erased from history He arrives back in in a winter jacket and ski goggles declaring that the mission was more complicated than he calculated but declaring it a success He holds up the tablet computer where the headline on the Hill Valley Telegraph changes from Griff Tannen Founds Grifftech to Griff Tannen Found Guilty Doc s excitement is short lived however as he reaches in his pocket He pulls out the Quantum Mind Jar which he thought he disposed of in He is worried that not doing so will unravel everything they accomplished The artificial intelligence of the Quantum Mind Jar tells Brown that they need to go back to the future which he dismisses as he does not want to risk further time travel Another Emmett Brown then arrives also
