id: 1385720
An audio commentary is an additional audio track usually digital consisting of a lecture or comments by one or more speakers that plays in real time with a video Commentaries can be serious or entertaining in nature and can add information which otherwise would not be disclosed to audience members Types of commentary The DVD medium allows multiple audio tracks for each video program DVD players usually allow these to be selected by the viewer from the main menu of the DVD or using the remote These tracks will contain dialogue and sound of the movie often with alternative tracks featuring different language dialogue or various types of audio encoding such as Dolby Digital DTS or PCM Among them may be at least one commentary track There are several different types of commentary The two main types simply define the length of the commentary rather than the type of content They are Partial or scene specific which only covers selected scenes of the film Sometimes these are recorded without the speaker viewing the film and thus the commentator may make more general comments than pointing out specific details Feature length or screen specific which is recorded in one session the speakers watch the movie from beginning to end and give their thoughts directly based on what is happening on screen Typically a commentary track will include feature length commentary from the film s director cast members or occasionally writers and producers Occasionally actors will perform commentary in character In recording sessions with multiple speakers a designated moderator may encourage the discussion flow Some DVDs include outsider commentary performed by film critics historians scholars or fans In more elaborate productions multiple speakers from various recording sessions may be edited together for a single audio program Some DVDs feature commentaries with on screen video enhancements such as telestrator prompts allowing the director or commentator to draw on the screen pointing out specific details or the Ghostbusters video commentary where one of the subtitle tracks is used to add silhouettes of the speakers in a manner where they seem to be in a theater commenting on the movie as it was screened for them in the style of Mystery Science Theater Less common are actual video commentaries showing the speakers as they are recording the commentary requiring separate video tracks History The value of audio commentaries as a marketing tool was revealed during the heyday of Laserdisc the laser based video format produced before the introduction of DVDs The Criterion Collection company for example produced high quality deluxe editions of classic films on Laserdisc using the best available prints and re edited versions These were often very expensive compared to today s DVDs and included bonus material such as trailers deleted scenes production stills behind the scenes information and audio commentaries from the directors producers cast cinematographers editors and production designers They were marketed to movie professionals fans and scholars who were seen as an elite niche of consumers who could afford to pay more for definitive quality editions The audio commentaries on laserdiscs were typically encoded on secondary analog tracks which had become redundant as modern Laserdiscs had stereo audio encoded digitally alongside This is why certain older videodisc players which pre date the digital audio standard are only able to play back analog tracks with audio commentary The first audio commentary was featured on the Criterion Collection release of the original King Kong film on laserdisc in December It featured film historian Ronald Haver and his first words were Hello ladies and gentlemen I m Ronald Haver and I m here to do something which we feel is rather unique I m going to take you on a lecture tour of King Kong as you watch the film The laserdisc technology offers us this opportunity and we feel it s rather unique the ability to switch back and forth between the soundtrack and this lecture track The idea for the commentary track arose in the film to tape transfer room when laserdisc producers Peter Crown and Jennifer Scanlin of Romulus Productions Inc thrilled by Haver s incredible commentary suggested to Bob Stein and Roger Smith that this material needed to be included on the disc They played back the completed movie as Ron watched and ad libbed his comments The decline of the Laserdisc format and the increasing popularity of DVD was highlighted in the fall of when simultaneous Laserdisc and DVD editions of the movie Contact were released The former contained one bonus audio commentary track by director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steve Starkey However the DVD contained two additional separate audio commentaries by Jodie Foster and the special effects producers as well as other bonus features Despite its history with laserdiscs the idea of audio commentary was still such an uncommon notion that in its January review of the Contact DVD Entertainment Weekly scoffed Who in the universe would want to journey through more than eight hours of gassy how we filmed the nebulae trivia included in this Special Edition disc Meant to show off DVD s enormous storage capacity it only demonstrates its capacity to accommodate mountains of filler In general directors are open to recording commentary tracks as many feel it can be helpful to young filmmakers or they simply want to explain their intention in making the film Eli Roth for example specifically states on the producer s commentary track for The Last Exorcism that he and the other filmmakers will offer advice to people interested in making films as well as film school students He is a strong proponent of the educational use of audio commentary having recorded five commentary tracks for his debut Cabin Fever He also recorded insightful commentary tracks with Quentin Tarantino for both Hostel films in which the two horror movie fans share film making anecdotes and offer advice on working in the movie business Meanwhile others such as Steven Spielberg Joe Johnston Clint Eastwood M Night Shyamalan David Lynch feel commentary can de mystify and cheapen a movie Director Steven Spielberg has not recorded commentary tracks for any of his films He feels that the experience of watching a film with anything other than his intended soundtrack detracts from what he has created Woody Allen has a similar lack of enthusiasm for commentaries stating I m not interested in all that extra stuff I want my films to speak for themselves And hopefully they do Similarity some of Joe Johnston s movies handled commentary by the special effects team like Jurassic Park III and Jumanji and by the author October Sky The only exception to this rule was Captain America The First Avenger Notable DVD audio commentaries A number of films and music videos released today feature audio commentaries While many of them will not hold the interest of the casual viewer specific releases stand out mainly those with elements of historical interest or subject specific information from expert advisors For example the inventor of the steadicam featured throughout the audio commentary track for The Shining discusses his work with the ground breaking technology in several films leading up to that landmark production Non movie buffs may be interested in the anecdotes offered by advisors to the filmmakers such as the FBI profiler commenting on The Silence of the Lambs Criterion DVD release Filmmakers and cast may reveal stories from behind the scenes explain the process involved in their work or simply offer additional laughs Films The science fiction movie Sunshine directed by Danny Boyle contains an audio track with physicist Brian Cox The author and professor who served as an advisor on the production discusses scientific accuracies and inaccuracies depicted in the movie The Blu ray edition of the film Galaxy Quest includes a tongue in cheek trivia commentary called Galactopedia Written by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda the Galactopedia purports to be based on Galaxy Quest encyclopedias technical manuals and other imaginary books that presumably come from the universe in which Galaxy Quest was a real TV show The Halestorm Entertainment movie Sons of Provo features a commentary on the film and then a commentary on the commentary where they discuss what they said in the commentary The DVD release of Ghostbusters contains a video commentary track with director Ivan Reitman writer star Harold Ramis and associate producer Joe Medjuck Silhouettes of the trio were added to the picture using one of the subtitle tracks in a manner that made it seem as if they were sitting in a theater commenting on the movie as it was screened for them This was seen as a homage to or imitation of Mystery Science Theater In some scenes arrows lines or circles may be drawn onto the screen to highlight things the directors are talking about The DVD releases of Men in Black and Muppets from Space had similar features The DVD release of Fantasia features two separate commentaries one by Roy E Disney James Levine John Canemaker and Scott MacQueen and a second by Walt Disney created using audio clips of interviews and a voice actor reading his production meeting notes hosted by Canemaker When its sequel Fantasia was released on DVD it also included two separate audio commentaries One featuring Roy E Disney Levine and Canemaker and the other featuring commentary on each of the separate segments of the film by the directors and art directors of each segment For the sections starring Mickey Mouse The Sorcerer s Apprentice and Donald Duck Pomp and

Atlantis The Lost Empire Special Edition Treasure Planet and Finding Nemo contained specially edited video commentaries the feature length audio commentaries by the directors and producers were

progress and play behind the scenes clips continuing to talk over the footage The DVD release of the third season of How I Met Your Mother includes a commentary by Jason Segel and Chris Harris for the episode The Chain of Screaming Harris a writer on the show did not write this particular episode but was included in the commentary at the request of Segel who spent the majority of the commentary intoxicated and in only his boxers Segel at one point places condoms on the table between the two and spends the majority of the commentary insinuating a relationship between him and Harris much to Harris chagrin The DVD of This Is Spinal Tap features a commentary by the three members of the band in character They relate how they felt slighted by the film and how the director Marty di Bergi in the film did a hack job with the documentary The commentary is another added element to the fiction of the band Actors Michael McKean Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer had previously recorded a

featuring many of the participants from that commentary was recorded for Orgazmo The fourth fifth and sixth season box sets of The Simpsons contain special illustrated commentaries on selected episodes where two animation directors draw on screen while commenting on the episode This is achieved by using subtitle data to produce the drawings overlaid on top of the video in sync with the

the four commentary tracks is given over entirely to a recording of the actors who played zombies in the movie The first cast audio commentary including Simon Pegg Nick Frost Kate Ashfield Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran also mocks audio commentaries as the cast admit that they almost never listen to them with Pegg claiming he listens to them when going to sleep as well as Moran saying that they simply involve people saying things like oh we used a steadi cam for that one because Roger had a bad knee and that no one was interested in hearing it There is a fake commentary on the DVD of Dodgeball A True Underdog Story with Rawson Marshall Thurber Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller arguing minutes into it all three exit and the commentary is replaced with the audio commentary from There s Something

not feel that adding one would help sales However director Darren Aronofsky recorded a commentary track on his own and made the track available for free download on his personal website In the DVD commentary for the first four series of the revived series of Doctor Who any commentary featuring head writer Russell T Davies would begin with Davies stating Hello faithful viewer In the Utopia

phrase a lot himself The special edition DVD of Child s Play did not feature any contributions from the director Tom Holland who claims he was not asked to contribute to it In response the website

podcast of an audio commentary returning to the theater a second time to watch the movie while listening to the commentary at the same time As of right now a few films have attempted to utilize this idea including Smith s Clerks II The Nines by writer director John August and Rian Johnson s The Brothers Bloom Looper and Knives Out August s blog lists rules and guidelines for how to use in theater commentary Kevin Smith first recorded a commentary track for Clerks II around May a few months before its theatrical release that was to be downloaded through iTunes and listened to in the theaters which was meant to appeal primarily to Smith s hardcore DVD purchasing fan base Theater owners however felt that allowing people to bring outside devices would be distracting and disrupting to other audience members The commentary track was not released for download while the movie was in theaters and was instead included on the disc Clerks II DVD The commentary track features Kevin Smith along with producer Scott Mosier and actor Jeff Anderson An audio commentary track for The Nines featuring John August along with actor Ryan Reynolds was posted in m a and mp formats onto August s blog This film had a considerably more limited release than Clerks II featured in only theaters in the U S Prolific commentators Novelist and film historian Tim Lucas has recorded close to audio commentaries

Soderbergh once said about DVD commentaries Would I growing up like to have had access to stuff on DVDs like this Oh God yeah It s better than any film school I think Animation historians such as Jerry Beck and Michael Barrier regularly contribute commentary to selected shorts in DVD packages of animated shorts from the Golden Age of Hollywood including the Looney Tunes Golden Collection series and the Popeye the Sailor DVD series Ken Annakin s audio commentary for his classic Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines holds a record for having one of the oldest surviving directors to commentate on a film In addition to the commentary during the film Annakin speaks on nearly hours of backup material on the old classic airplanes that many fans consider the real stars of the film Alternate commentaries Originally inspired by a column by Roger Ebert a small but active fan base of DVD commentary enthusiasts has sprung up since offering their own specially recorded fan made DVD commentaries These tracks usually made available in MP format allow the fans to put forth their own opinions and expertise on a movie or TV series in much the same way as an on disc commentary These commentary tracks are played by starting a DVD player with the movie and an MP player with the track simultaneously A substantial community of fan commentators exists creating many hundreds of downloadable tracks available on the Web The idea of downloadable commentary tracks has since been co opted by TV show creators themselves as creators of TV shows such as the Battlestar Galactica Star Trek Enterprise and the Doctor Who revival have recorded downloadable commentary tracks meant to be watched along with the episodes as recorded from TV Mystery Science Theater head writer and on screen host Michael J Nelson has started his own website to sell downloadable commentaries called RiffTrax He also regularly commentates on the public domain films that colorizing company Legend Films releases on DVD including Night of the Living Dead and Reefer Madness Critiques and parodies of the audio commentary The Audio Commentary has been a subject of discussion among filmmakers Many directors see them as an unnecessary bonus feature while others record fake commentaries which may contain false information or inside jokes Other filmmakers have parodied the commentary concept as the following examples demonstrate The Coen Brothers movie Blood Simple has a fake commentary written by the Coens and read by an actor posing as a film historian This historian Kenneth Loring gives information about the production that almost everyone would recognize as being totally ludicrous He claims for instance that one the opening scene was shot upside down with the actors saying their lines backwards and that some roles were reserved for Rosemary Clooney and Gene Kelly In an episode of The Simpsons The Bart Wants What It Wants Bart is watching an Itchy Scratchy DVD and decides to turn the commentary on A small box appears at the corner of the screen showing Scratchy We shot this at four in the morning and the crew was getting a little cranky and Itchy You can never get enough takes for Steven Soderbergh midway through Scratchy s next sentence Itchy cuts off his head Welsh comedian Rob Brydon starred in the ITV comedy show Director s Commentary in which he played a fictional director Peter De Lane and parodied the often conceited and pompous nature of directors when giving DVD commentaries by articulating his thoughts over archive footage Although the show was well received it did not sustain viewer interest and as of only one six episode season was produced The book Speak Commentary by Jeff Alexander and Tom Bissell collects a series of fake audio commentaries purportedly made by well known American cultural critics and political pundits on popular science fiction and fantasy movies The contents include Ann Coulter on Ridley Scott s Alien as well as Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn on Peter Jackson s films of J R R Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers The DVD and Blu ray for the musical web series Dr Horrible s Sing Along Blog contains two commentary tracks one of which comprises an entirely second musical titled Commentary The Musical in which they parody the concept of both DVD commentaries and musicals in general In addition to songs by the main cast members often parodying their own public personas or each others it includes numbers by unnamed extras in the film and a song explaining how the Writers Guild of America strike led to the creation of the web series The Adam and Joe Show parodied audio commentaries in a sketch which stated that audio commentaries often sound like self indulgent wankers in a pub Webtoon Homestar Runner has featured the characters of the H R universe doing commentaries for many of their cartoons Most notably The King of Town DVD In Search of the Yello Dello and the music video for They Might Be Giants Experimental Film Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy contains audio commentary where the actors end up discussing very little of the film s content Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby features a commentary in which director Adam McKay fabricates nearly every piece of information about the film such as the production s move to Brazil the roles of Walker and Texas Ranger being played by robots and that the original cut of the film was hours long and contained a segment of a stick of butter Monty Python s The Meaning of Life features a fake commentary titled Soundtrack for the Lonely A Soundtrack for People Watching at Home Alone It consists of a rather disgusting man played by Michael Palin who burps yawns flatulates and talks under his breath while he watches the film at his flat Throughout the commentary he calls his friends played by Terry Jones and Eric Idle by telephone The Hot Fuzz disc collector s edition DVD includes a commentary featuring real policemen and a commentary in which director Edgar Wright and fellow filmmaker Quentin Tarantino discuss nearly films and television series but barely make reference to Hot Fuzz In an episode of the series King of the Hill Bobby listens to the audio commentary of a fictional film The film s director remarks that the sky wasn t sad enough for the scene In the American Dad episode Bullocks to Stan the fish character Klaus Heissler purposely begins to audibly give a commentary on the events of the episode when Roger asks what he s doing he says that he is acting as if the characters lives were on a DVD and he is the expert giving commentary on it Near the end of the episode his commentary can be heard over the events of the climactic fight between Stan and Bullock despite the fact that Klaus is not present at this event like he is at previous events he comments on in the episode he claims that the actor playing the busboy was killed during the making of the episode and at one point apologizes for talking over what he claims is the funniest line in the episode The actual audio commentary for the episode mentions the joke that Klaus talked out was Stan saying Kirk was a much better captain Bullock saying What and Stan replying Nothing In the film Tropic Thunder Robert Downey Jr plays an actor who refuses to break character until he completes the DVD commentary and in the DVD commentary for the film Downey indeed remains in character Detective Pikachu includes a Mr Mime Audio Commentary where he presents himself and shows he is going to make an audio commentary about the interrogation scene of the movie However it only plays the entire scene and in the end he expresses himself by the fact that since he cannot talk the audio commentary plan was not the smartest idea Commentary re use Some film companies transfer the audio commentary of the laserdisc release of a film on to the DVD rather than creating a new one For example El Mariachi Special Edition Total Recall Special Edition Spaceballs and A Nightmare on Elm Street all contain the commentary from the laserdisc release This may be for financial reasons depending on whether the rights to the original commentary are cheaper to use than recording a new one a company releasing a film on DVD today may not be the same company who released it on laserdisc or it could simply be that the original commentary does its job well without the need for an update Contrastingly some DVDs do not have a commentary even though the laserdisc release did for example Taxi Driver This may be because the parties involved have not reached a publication agreement The audio commentaries of The Criterion Collection are often considered some of the finest and most informative commentaries ever made and the Laserdisc releases of classic films can be highly priced because Criterion generally did not license their commentaries for use on later DVDs when the rights to films they have release revert to the studio including the aforementioned Taxi Driver But commentaries like that now appear on the Blu ray versions of films Other notables include the commentary for The Silence of the Lambs featuring stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins along with director Jonathan Demme and Terry Gilliam s tracks for The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and The Fisher King In addition the fact that Criterion have been commissioning commentaries since means that commentaries exist by film makers who died before the advent of DVD such as Michael Powell Commentary exclusive to LaserDisc Some commentaries that were issued on Laserdisc have not been reissued or replaced on DVD Sometimes this is because there was a deluxe LD edition while there has only been a bare bones release on DVD for example The Fisher King In the case of the first three James Bond movies Dr No From Russia with Love and Goldfinger the commentary was once released on LaserDisc but quickly judged inappropriate never to return new commentary tracks are on the DVD editions The commentaries are available to download at The Dossier Video games Some video games such as the episodic sequels to Half Life and Tomb Raider Anniversary have experimented with audio commentaries Unlike DVD commentaries the systems used for video games do not use a predetermined continuous flow of speech because the events of a game depend on the player s actions Instead in game prompts are used to allow players to activate a relevant audio commentary for a specific area The camera and action may also be altered to more readily showcase the developer s comments List of video games with audio commentary Star Wars Episode I Battle for Naboo believed to be the earliest video
