system of education also has other recognized categories like the polytechnics and colleges of education The Polytechnic gives out National Diploma and Higher National Diploma certifications after a period of two years and or four years of study respectively Higher National Diploma also known as HND can be obtained in a different institution from where the National Diploma also known as ND or OND was obtained However the HND cannot be obtained without the OND certificate On the other hand the respective colleges of education provide students with the Nigerian Certificate in Education NCE after a two year period of study South Africa In South Africa education is divided into four bands Foundation Phase grades Intermediate Phase grades Senior Phase grades and the Further Education and Training or FET Phase grades However because this division is newer than most schools in the country in practice learners progress through three different types of school primary school grades junior school grades and high school grades After the FET phase learners who pursue further studies typically take three or four years to obtain an undergraduate degree or one or two years to achieve a vocational diploma or certificate The number of years spent in university varies as different courses of study take different numbers of years Those in the last year of high school Grade are referred to as Matrics or are in Matric and take the Grade examinations accredited by the Umalusi Council the South African board of education in October and November of their Matric year Exam papers are set and administered nationally through the National Department of Basic Education for government schools while many but not all private school Matrics sit for exams set by the Independent Education Board IEB which operates with semi autonomy under the requirements of Umalusi The assessment and learning requirements of both IEB and National exams are of roughly the same standard The perceived better performance of learners within the IEB exams is largely attributable to their attending private better resourced schools with the much lower teacher learner ratios and class sizes rather than because of fundamental differences in assessment or learning content A school year for the majority of schools in South Africa runs from January to December with holidays dividing the year into terms Most

provinces The overall school curricula are overseen by the provincial and territorial governments therefore the way educational stages are grouped and named can differ Education is generally divided into primary secondary and post secondary stages Primary and secondary education are generally divided into annual grades from to although grade may be preceded by one or two years of kindergarten

university or high school Second year In the U S a sophomore also called a soph is a second year student Outside the United States the term sophomore is rarely used with second year students simply

Oxford English Dictionary It is widely assumed to be formed from Greek Sophos meaning wise and Moros meaning foolish although the etymology suggests an origin from the now defunct sophomore an obsolete variant of sophism Post second year In the U S a Junior is a student in the penultimate usually third year and a Senior is a student in the last usually fourth year of college university or high school A student who takes more than the average number of years to graduate is sometimes referred to as a super senior This term is often used in college but can be used in high school as well

student in tertiary education at a university or a college is normally classified as an undergraduate student who is at least years old at the start of their course and usually having been out of the education system for at least two years Mature students can also include students who have been out of the education system for decades or students with no secondary education Mature students also make up graduate and postgraduate populations by demographic of age Student pranks University students have been associated with pranks and japes since the creation of universities in the Middle Ages These can often involve petty crime such as the theft of traffic cones and other public property or hoaxes It is also not uncommon for students from one school to steal or deface the mascot of a rival school In fact pranks play such a significant part in student culture that numerous books have been published that focus on the issue Other terms Students who are repeating a grade level of schooling due to poor grades are sometimes referred to as having been held back or kept back In Malaysia and Singapore they are described as retained In the Philippines they are called repeater The term pupil originally a Latin term for a minor as the ward of an adult guardian etc is used in some Commonwealth primary and secondary schools particularly in England and Wales instead of student but once attending further education at a sixth form college or higher education at university for example the term student is standard The term pupil is also used in the Philippines by the Department of Education to refer to learners currently in elementary school the term student is used for by the Department of Education for learners in high school The United States military academies officially use only numerical terms but there are colloquial expressions used in everyday speech In order from first year to fourth year students are referred to as fourth class third class second class and first class cadets or midshipmen Unofficially other terms are used for example at the United States Military Academy freshmen are called plebes sophomores are called yearlings or yuks juniors are called cows and seniors are called firsties Some universities also use numerical terms to identify classes students enter as first years and graduate as fourth years or in some cases fifth years sixth years etc Idiomatic use Freshman and sophomore are sometimes used figuratively almost exclusively in the United States to refer to a first or second effort the singer s sophomore album or to a politician s first or second term in office freshman senator or an athlete s first or second year on a professional sports team Junior and senior are not used in this figurative way to refer to third and fourth years or efforts because of those words broader meanings of younger and older A junior senator is therefore not one who is in a third term of office but merely one who has not been in the Senate as long as the other senator from their state Confusingly this means that it is possible to be both a freshman senator and a senior senator simultaneously for example if a senator wins election in and then the other senator from the same state steps down and a new senator elected in the former senator is both senior senator having been in the Senate for two years longer and a freshman senator being still in their first term International Students Day International Students Day November remembers the anniversary of the Nazi storming of the University of Prague after student
