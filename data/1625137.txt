The Simpson family are the fictional characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons The Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children Bart Lisa and Maggie They live at Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield United States and they were created by cartoonist Matt Groening who conceived the characters after his own family members substituting Bart for his own name The family debuted on Fox on April in The Tracey Ullman Show short Good Night and were later spun off into their own series which debuted on Fox in the U S on December Alongside the five main family members there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family The most commonly recurring characters are Homer s father Abraham Grampa Simpson Marge s sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier and the family s two pets Santa s Little Helper and Snowball II Other family members include Homer s mother Mona Simpson Homer s half brother Herbert Powell Marge s mother Jacqueline Bouvier and other minor relatives Concept and origins Creation Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L Brooks s office Brooks had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series However when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life s work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family He named the characters after his own family members his father Homer his mother Margaret and his younger sisters Lisa and Maggie He substituted Bart an anagram of brat for his own name and modeled the character after his older brother Mark The five family members were given simple designs so that their facial emotions could easily be changed with almost no effort and so that they would be recognizable in silhouette Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production However the animators merely re traced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes The Simpson family made their debut on April in The Tracey Ullman Show short Good Night In the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons a half hour series airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company The Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show Casting Dan Castellaneta Julie Kavner Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith all began voicing their characters on The Tracey Ullman Show Nancy Cartwright was the only one of the group who had been trained to be a voice actor while Castellaneta had done some voice over work in Chicago Castellaneta and Kavner had been part of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and voices were needed for the shorts so the producers decided to ask them to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high Smith later recalled I always sounded too much like a girl I read two lines as Bart and they said Thanks for coming Smith was given the role of Lisa instead On March Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of Lisa After arriving at the audition she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart who she found more fascinating because he was described as devious underachieving school hating irreverent and clever Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead and upon hearing her read gave her the job on the spot The Simpson family The Simpsons are a family who live at Evergreen Terrace in the town of Springfield in the United States The state in which this town is located is never specified however they do have snow and sometimes wear sweaters in the fall It s a running joke in the show to be as vague and ambiguous as possible whenever hinting at which U S state the town of Springfield might be located in Homer the father works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant a position at odds with his careless buffoonish personality He is married to Marge Simpson a stereotypical American housewife and mother They have three children Bart a ten year old troublemaker Lisa an eight year old child prodigy and Maggie a toddler who rarely speaks but communicates by sucking on a pacifier The family owns a dog Santa s Little Helper and a cat Snowball II Both pets have had starring roles in several seasons Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear as they did at the end of the s Although the family is dysfunctional many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another Homer Simpson Homer Jay Simpson voiced by Dan Castellaneta is the protagonist of the show and the father of the Simpson family He embodies several American working class stereotypes he is crude overweight incompetent clumsy thoughtless and a borderline alcoholic He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the situation calls for it and an integrity reflecting his own values including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his family His voice started out as an impression of Walter Matthau but eventually evolved into a more robust voice during the second and third season of the half hour show allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions Homer has since become one of the most influential fictional characters and has been described by the UK newspaper The Sunday Times as the greatest comedic creation of modern time He has inspired an entire line of merchandise and his catchphrase the annoyed grunt D oh has been included in the Oxford English Dictionary During the production of the episode Insane Clown Poppy the writers toyed with the idea of giving Homer a long lost illegitimate biological daughter but when the shows showrunner and writer Mike Scully as well as Matt Groening rejected the idea the writers changed the story so the clown Krusty would be the one who finds he has a lost daughter Marge Simpson Marjorie Jacqueline Marge Simpson n e Bouvier voiced by Julie Kavner is the well meaning and extremely patient wife of Homer and mother of Bart Lisa and Maggie She often acts as the voice of reason but displays exaggerated behavior traits of stereotypical mothers and takes the blatant dysfunctionality of her family for granted unlike the other family members who are aware that they are eccentric Her most notable physical feature is her blue hair styled into an improbably high beehive Julie Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award in for voicing Marge in the episode I Married Marge For her performance in The Simpsons Movie Kavner received a nomination for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature at the Annie Awards but lost to Ian Holm in Ratatouille Kavner s emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews and one critic said she gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever Part of Kavner s contract says that she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video because she does not want to destroy the illusion for children In CityNews published an article entitled Top Greatest TV Moms of All Time and placed Marge in eighth spot Bart Simpson Bartholomew Jay Bart Simpson voiced by Nancy Cartwright is the eldest child and only son in the family at age Bart s most prominent character traits are his mischievousness rebelliousness disrespect for authority and sharp wit During the first two seasons of The Simpsons Bart was the show s main character The name Bart is an anagram of the word brat Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person Groening s older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart Bart s catchphrase Eat My Shorts was an ad lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings harking back to an incident when she was at college In Time magazine selected Bart as th of the most influential people of the th century and the only fictional character to make the list He had previously appeared on the cover of the December edition Bart is rebellious and frequently escapes without punishment which led some parents groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children This prompted George H W Bush to rally We re going to keep trying to strengthen the American family To make them more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons Bart and other Simpsons characters have appeared in numerous television commercials for Nestl s Butterfinger candy bars from to with the slogan Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger Lisa Simpson Lisa Marie Simpson voiced by Yeardley Smith is the eldest daughter and middle child of the family She is an extremely intelligent year old girl one of the most intelligent characters on the show Lisa s political convictions are generally socially liberal She is a vegetarian and a supporter of the Free Tibet movement and while still supportive of the Christian church in which she was raised Lisa became a practicing Buddhist following her decision to follow the Noble Eightfold Path She is musically proficient on the saxophone besides the occasional riff during the opening credit sequence Carole King s Jazzman and Gerry Rafferty s Baker Street have been prominently placed during episodes In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts Lisa was more of a female Bart and was equally mischievous As the series progressed Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional character with Krusty Gets Busted being one of the first episodes where her true intelligence is fully shown When she was a baby Bart started out not liking her although he became nicer to her after Marge pointed out that Lisa loves him Her first word was Bart with Bart happily teaching her more names Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature the first one being Moaning Lisa The idea for the episode was pitched by James L Brooks who had wanted to do an emotional episode where Lisa is sad because the show had done a lot of jokey episodes In Lisa received a special board of directors Ongoing Commitment Award at the Environmental Media Awards Lisa the Vegetarian an episode from the seventh season won both an Environmental Media Award for Best Television Episodic Comedy and a Genesis Award for Best Television Comedy Series Ongoing Commitment In Japan the broadcasters of the series found they were able to turn the apparent viewer dislike of the series around by focusing marketing attention on Lisa Lisa s well intended but ill fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and city struck a chord with the Japanese Maggie Simpson Margaret Evelyn Lenny Maggie Simpson is the youngest of the five main family members and is almost always seen as a baby She has blonde spiked hair like Lisa Her first word was daddy shown at one point after Homer tucks her in She is almost years old and still uses a pacifier despite teething although this was mentioned in a Treehouse of Horror episode Starship Poopers and is not considered canon She was quite prominent in the Tracey Ullman Show shorts often being featured alongside Bart and Lisa but has since become the least seen and heard of the five main Simpsons It has been revealed that Maggie has outstanding artistic and academic abilities much like her sister Lisa The episodes taking place in the future often show her as some kind of businesswoman Maggie rarely speaks but has been voiced by several different actors including Jodie Foster Elizabeth Taylor James Earl Jones Harry Shearer who used his Kang voice in Starship Poopers Yeardley Smith and Nancy Cartwright Abe Simpson Abraham Jebediah Abe Simpson II better known simply as Grampa voiced by Dan Castellaneta is the patriarch of the Simpson family and the father of Homer He is a World War II veteran who was later sent to the Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer He is known for his borderline senility his long rambling and probably apocryphal stories and his love of Matlock He shares his name with one of Matt Groening s relatives in this case his grandfather However Groening says he refused to name him leaving it to other writers to choose a name By coincidence the writers chose the name Abraham Mona Simpson Mona Penelope Simpson n e Olsen voiced by Glenn Close is Homer s long lost mother Marge s mother in law and Abe s estranged first wife Her first major appearance was in Mother Simpson where she reveals that she was forced to abandon her family after being caught up in the hippie movement and participated in various acts of activism The writers used this episode as an opportunity to solve several little puzzles such as where Lisa s intelligence came from Prior to the seventh season Mona Simpson had only made two brief flashback appearances the first being season two s Oh Brother Where Art Thou and the second being season six s Grampa vs Sexual Inadequacy and in both episodes she was voiced by Maggie Roswell Mona dies in the episode Mona Leaves a as Homer struggles to come to terms with her death The character is named after writer Richard Appel s wife whose name is Mona Simpson Mona was designed in a way so that she has little bit of Homer in her face such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman but still be Simpson esque Glenn Close recorded original material for another episode season fifteen s My Mother the Carjacker Mona also has a speaking appearance in season ten

he had a blood family Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer as a representative of average Americans to design a car The car was a flop bankrupting the company and Herb angrily rejected Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant The episode was written by Jeff Martin but the idea of having Herb voiced by Danny DeVito had been pitched by Sam Simon Some were upset with the sad ending of the episode and as a result the producers decided to make a sequel Herb re appeared the next season in Brother Can You Spare Two Dimes Now broke and homeless he briefly settled in the Simpson household despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer Homer loaned Herb which he used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English based on observations he made of Maggie He proceeded to mass produce his new product and regained his fortune In gratitude he bought gifts for each member of the family and paid Homer back with his forgiveness Homer s
