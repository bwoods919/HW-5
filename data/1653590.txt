Channel is a non profit monthly short film festival in Los Angeles which has a sister festival in New York City Channel NY Channel is a creation of Dan Harmon and Rob Schrab in which participants submit a short film in the format of a pilot under five minutes in length The event is structured such that a panel of previously successful submitters choose what pilots are shown and a live audience at The Downtown Independent decides which pilots continue as a series for the next screening in much the same way TV programs are rated and managed According to the Channel website Channel is a chance to sit in the worn out chair of the fat network exec drunk on the blood of lowly artists whose right to exist is given in exchange for their ability to nourish You run the network You pick the programming Concept Roughly once a month a screening for Channel occurs at the Downtown Independent theater in Los Angeles with usually ten shorts being screened At the screening the audience votes on which pilots they would like to see return The top five shows are entered into the prime time slots on the Channel website and get to make a follow up episode for the next screening This process continues with new episodes being shown at each screening until one fails to make the top five at which point the series is cancelled Some successful shows can choose to be cancelled voluntarily by running over five minutes disqualifying the show from continuing and leaving one last un voted episode Shows that fail to make the prime time spot are known as failed pilots An added benefit of having a prime time series is that prime time directors are part of the panel that decides which five new pilots will be shown alongside the five established shows from the previous screening Shows that fail to make the screenings are known as rejected pilots Each calendar year of the festival is referred to as a season comprising screenings due to there being no December screening plus month break to allow the creators to rest between spring summer and the November screening which is the yearly awards show called the Incredibly Prestigious Achievement Award or Channy so named as a parody of Emmy The Channy Awards have been held times as of Other rules have been tried out most notably the Chauncey named after director Chris Chauncey the first to invoke the rule wherein a director could overrule the voting panel and force their pilot to be screened but the audience had the option of stopping the film at any time Introduced in October it was done away with in November due to the popularity of the festival making it difficult for the honor system to be viable Only one Chauncey made prime time Dick Richards Private Dick The name Channel does not imply a school or a classroom Channel derives its name from the prevailing Hollywood method of numbering a TV show s seasons and episodes Since it is a festival for pilots all of the screenings start off as episode of their series History The idea for Channel began in when Schrab invited several friends over for a screening of Jaws The Revenge but challenged them to bring a short film predicting what would happen in the film In three more short film challenges were issued but the group of viewers outgrew Schrab s living room Instead the screening was moved to the backroom of an LA nightclub Additionally friends of friends of the filmmakers were beginning to ask what this festival was called and how they could enter In Schrab and Harmon named their creation the Super Midnight Movie Show and decided on a monthly screening and a five minute format However they realized that once the show started growing it would only be a matter of time before a large number of low quality submissions were entered and filmmakers would need to be turned away for time constraints They decided to adopt a TV network like ratings model where the audience votes on which films they like and popular filmmakers were allowed to screen more films accordingly In a pilot for a reality show about Channel and its filmmakers was shopped to FX Networks but was eventually passed on A sketch comedy show based on the format of Channel and executive produced by Harmon and Schrab aired on VH The show was called Acceptable TV and it began airing March The success of Channel led to a sister film festival in New York City Channel NY Notable
