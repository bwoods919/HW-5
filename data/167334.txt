An adult is a human or other animal that has reached full growth The biological definition of the word means an animal reaching sexual maturity and thus capable of reproduction In the human context the term adult has meanings associated with social and legal concepts In contrast to a non adult or minor a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent self sufficient and responsible They may also be regarded as a major The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is although definition may vary by legal rights country and psychological development Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory a person may be biologically an adult and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority Conversely one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood or reaching a specified age sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood Biological adulthood Historically and cross culturally adulthood has been determined primarily by the start of puberty the appearance of secondary sex characteristics such as menstruation and the development of breasts in women ejaculation the development of facial hair and a deeper voice in men and pubic hair in both sexes In the past a person usually moved from the status of child directly to the status of adult often with this shift being marked by some type of coming of age test or ceremony During the Industrial Revolution children went to work as soon as they could in order to help provide for their family There was not a huge emphasis on school or education in general Many children could get a job and were not required to have experience as adults are nowadays After the social construct of adolescence was created adulthood split into two forms biological adulthood and social adulthood Thus there are now two primary forms of adults biological adults people who have attained reproductive ability are fertile or who evidence secondary sex characteristics and social adults people who are recognized by their culture or law as being adults Depending on the context adult can indicate either definition Another aspect of adulthood that is relatively new is psychological functioning According to Jeffrey Arnett adults can make financial decisions on their own are financially independent and are able to make difficult life decisions on their own Although few or no established dictionaries provide a definition for the two word term biological adult the first definition of adult in multiple dictionaries includes the stage of the life cycle of an animal after reproductive capacity has been attained Thus the base definition of the word adult is the period beginning at physical sexual maturity which occurs sometime after the onset of puberty Although this is the primary definition of the base word adult the term is also frequently used to refer to social adults The two word term biological adult stresses or clarifies that the original definition based on physical maturity i e having reached reproductive competency is being used The time of puberty varies from child to child but usually begins between and years old Girls typically begin the process of puberty at age or and boys at age or Girls generally complete puberty by and boys by age or Nutrition genetics and environment also usually play a part in the onset of puberty Girls will go through a growth spurt and gain weight in several areas of their body Boys will go through similar spurts in growth though it is usually not in a similar style or time frame This is due to the natural processes of puberty but genetics also plays a part in how much weight they gain or how much taller they get One recent area of debate within the science of brain development is the most likely chronological age for full mental maturity or indeed if such an age even exists Common claims repeated in the media since based upon interpretations of imaging data have commonly suggested an end point of referring to the prefrontal cortex as one area that is not yet fully mature at the age of However this is based on an interpretation of a brain imaging study by Jay Giedd dating back to or where the only participants were aged up to years and Giedd assumed this maturing process would be done by the age of years whereas more recent studies show prefrontal cortex maturation continuing well past the age of years marking this interpretation as incorrect and outdated Legal adulthood Legally adulthood typically means that one has reached the age of majority when parents lose parental rights and responsibilities regarding the person concerned Depending on one s jurisdiction the age of majority may or may not be set independently of and should not be confused with the minimum ages applicable to other activities such as engaging in a contract marriage voting having a job serving in the military buying possessing firearms driving traveling abroad involvement with alcoholic beverages smoking sexual activity gambling being a model or actor in pornography running for President etc Admission of a young person to a place may be restricted because of danger for that person concern that the place may lead the person to immoral behavior or because of the risk that the young person causes damage for example at an exhibition of fragile items One can distinguish the legality of acts of a young person or of enabling a young person to carry out that act by selling renting out showing permitting entrance allowing participation etc There may be distinction between commercially and socially enabling Sometimes there is the requirement of supervision by a legal guardian or just by an adult Sometimes there is no requirement but rather a recommendation Using the example of pornography one can distinguish between being allowed inside an adult establishment being allowed to purchase pornography being allowed to possess pornography another person being allowed to sell rent out or show the young person pornography see disseminating pornography to a minor being a pornographic actor rules for the young person and for other people regarding production possession etc see child pornography With regard to films with violence etc another person being allowed to sell rent out or show the young person a film a cinema being allowed to let a young person enterThe age of majority ranges internationally from ages to with being the most common age Nigeria Mali Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon define adulthood at age but marriage of girls at an earlier age is common In most of the world the legal adult age is for most purposes with some notable exceptions The legal age of adulthood in British Columbia New Brunswick Newfoundland and Labrador Northwest Territories Nova Scotia Nunavut and Yukon in Canada is though there are some exceptions in which Canadians may be considered legal adults in certain situations like sexual consent which is age and criminal law federal elections and the military which is at The legal age of adulthood in Nebraska and Alabama in the United States is The legal age of adulthood in South Korea is The legal age of adulthood in Mississippi and Puerto Rico in the U S is Prior to the s young people were not classed as adults until in most western nations For example in the United States young citizens could not vote in many elections until until July when the th Amendment passed mandating that the right to vote cannot be abridged for anyone or older The voting age was lowered in response to the fact that young men between the ages of and were drafted into the army to fight in the Vietnam War hence the popular slogan old enough to fight old enough to vote Young people under in the US could also not purchase alcohol purchase handguns sign a binding contract or marry without permission from parents After the voting age was lowered many states also moved to lower the drinking age with most states having a minimum age of or and also to lower the age of legal majority adulthood to However there are legal activities where is not the default age of adulthood There are still some exceptions where or even higher is still the benchmark for certain rights or responsibilities For example in the US the Gun Control Act of prohibits those under from purchasing a handgun from a federally licensed dealer although federal law makes an exception for individuals between the ages of and to obtain one from a private dealer if state law permits As of July the National Minimum Drinking Age Act mandated that all states raise their respective drinking ages to to create a uniform standard for legally purchasing drinking or publicly possessing alcohol with exceptions made for consumption only in private residences under parental supervision and permission This was done in response to reduce the number of drunk driving fatalities prevalent among young drivers States that choose not to comply can lose up to of highway funding The Credit Card Act of imposed tougher safeguards for young adults between the ages of and obtaining a credit card Young adults under the age of must either have a co signer or older or show proof usually a source of income that they can repay their credit card balance Unless that requirement is met one must wait until to be approved for a credit card on their own The Affordable Care Act of expands the age that young adults can remain on their parent s health insurance plan up to age As of December the federal government raised the legal age to purchase tobacco and vaping products from to In states where recreational marijuana is legalized the default age is also though those younger may be able to obtain medical marijuana prescriptions or cards upon seeing a physician Gambling also varies from to depending on the state and many rental car companies do not rent cars to those under and have surcharges for drivers under although this is not codified and is company policy In Quebec Canada the Quebec legislature in raised the age one could purchase recreational marijuana from to stepping out of line with most of the country that set a minimum age of except Alberta which is The Quebec government cited the risk that marijuana poses to the brain development of people under as justification for the age raise In March the state of Washington in a decision justices in the Supreme Court of the State of Washington tossed the life without parole sentences of a year old and a year old convicted in separate cases of first degree aggravated murder decades ago saying as with juveniles the court must first consider the age of those under before sentencing them to die behind bars This comes at a time where there are ongoing debates about whether those between and should be exempted from the death penalty In Germany courts largely sentence defendants under the age of according to juvenile law in a bid to help them reintegrate into society and mete out punishments that fit the crime as well as the offender In May the state of Texas raised the age that one can be an exotic dancer and work and patronize sexually oriented businesses from to In the UK there have been many proposals to raise the age that one can buy tobacco from to in an attempt to curb teen and young adult use to get to a smoke free UK by All of these laws made over the years reflect the growing awareness that young adults while not children are still in a transitional stage between adolescence and full adulthood and that there should be policy adjustments or restrictions where necessary especially where it pertains to activities that carry certain degrees of risk or harm to themselves or others At the same time however even though the generally accepted age of majority is in most nations there are rights or privileges afforded to adolescents who have not yet reached legal adulthood In the United States youth are able to get a part time job at provided they have a work permit At one is able to obtain a driver s permit or license depending on state laws and is able to work most jobs except ones requiring heavy machinery and consent to sexual activity depending on the state At one is able to enlist in the armed forces with parental consent although they cannot be deployed to be in combat roles until age The voting age for local elections in most American cities is But in five localities nationwide four of which are in Maryland and year olds are eligible to vote The cities are Takoma Park Riverdale Greenbelt and Hyattsville In students or older in Oakland California gained the right to vote in school board elections There is a growing movement to lower the voting age in the US and many other countries from to in hopes of engaging the youth vote and encouraging greater electoral participation Some countries already have a voting age of which include Austria Scotland Argentina Brazil Wales Cuba and Ecuador In Germany one can purchase beer and wine at the age of although they cannot purchase spirits or hard liquor until The age of consent in Germany is if both partners are under but at least Sexual activity with a person under is punishable if the adult is a person of authority over the minor in upbringing education care or employment Social construction of adulthood In contrast to biological perspectives of aging and adulthood social scientists conceptualize adulthood as socially constructed While aging is an established biological process the attainment of adulthood is social in its criteria In contrast to other perspectives that conceptualize aging and the attainment of adulthood as a largely universal development regardless of context nation generation gender race or social class Social scientists regard these aspects as paramount in cultural definitions of adulthood Further evidence of adulthood as a social construction is illustrated by the changing criteria of adulthood over time Historically adulthood in the U S has rested on completing one s education moving away from the family of origin and beginning one s career Other key historical criteria include entering a marriage and becoming a parent These criteria are social and subjective they are organized by gender race ethnicity social class among other key identity markers As a result particular populations feel adult earlier in the life course than do others Contemporary experiences of and research on young adults today substitute more seemingly subjective criteria for adulthood which resonate more soundly with young adults experiences of aging The criteria are marked by a growing importance of individualistic criteria and the irrelevance of the demographic markers of normative conceptions of adulthood In particular younger cohorts attainment of adulthood centers on three criteria gaining a sense of responsibility independent decision making and financial independence Jeffrey Arnett a psychologist and professor at Clark University in Massachusetts studied the development of adults and argues that there is a new and distinct period of development in between adolescence and adulthood This stage which he calls emerging adulthood occurs between the ages of and Arnett describes these individuals as able to take some responsibility for their lives but still not completely feeling like an adult Arnett articulates five distinct features that are unique to this period of development identity exploration feeling in between instability self focus and having possibilities The first feature identity exploration describes emerging adults making decisions for themselves about their career education and love life This is a time of life when a young person has yet to finalize these decisions but are pondering them making them feel somewhere in between adolescent and adult This leads into a second feature of this phase of life feeling in between Emerging adults feel that they are taking on responsibilities but do not feel like a full adult quite yet Next the instability feature notes that emerging adults often move around after their high school years whether that is to college friends houses or living with a romantic partner This moving around often ends once the individual s family and career have been set Tagging along with the instability feature is having self focus Emerging adults being away from their parental and societal routines are now able to do what they want when they want and where they want before they are put back into a routine when they start a marriage family and career Arnett s last feature of emerging adulthood an age of possibilities characterizes this stage as one where optimism reigns These individuals believe they have a good chance of turning out better than their parents did Religion According to Jewish tradition adulthood is reached at age for Jewish boys and for Jewish girls in accordance with the Bar or Bat Mitzvah they are expected to demonstrate preparation for adulthood by learning the Torah and other Jewish practices The Christian Bible and Jewish scripture contain no age requirement for adulthood or marrying which includes engaging in sexual activity The Code of Canon Law states A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age and likewise a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age cannot enter a valid marriage According to The Disappearance of Childhood by Neil Postman the Christian Church of the Middle Ages considered the age of accountability when a person could be tried and even executed as an adult to be age While certain religions have their guidelines on what it means to be an adult generally speaking there are trends that occur regarding religiosity as individuals transition from adolescence to adulthood The role of religion in one s life can impact development during adolescence The National Library of Medicine NCBI highlights some studies that show rates of religiosity declining as people move out of the house and live on their own Oftentimes when people live on their own they change their life goals and religion tends to be less important as they discover who they are Other studies from the NCBI show that as adults get married and have children they settle down and as they do there tends to be an increase in religiosity Everyone s level of religiosity builds at a different pace meaning that religion relative to adult development varies across cultures and time See also References
