was seen as a dedicated scholar when it came to research He devoted fifteen years of his life to just studying his finding of the Secret Gospel Mar Saba letter In Smith at age was on a trip to the holy land with the Harvard Divinity School Due to issues relating to the war he was stuck in Jerusalem where he made acquaintances with a leader of the Greek Orthodox Church who gave him a tour of various places one of which happened to be the Mar Saba monastery While there Smith was given access to the libraries of the monastery Years later in having landed a teaching career at Columbia Smith was awarded a sabbatical With his sabbatical Smith decided to return to Mar Saba having since become very interested in the Mar Saba library He recalled that during his first visit the library had been a terrible mess and according to Smith no one had bothered to catalog it Smith reported he found the manuscript in the Mar Saba monastery in photographed it carefully and then left the book where he found it He first publicized the discovery in but due to various delays his main publications on the subject did not come out until Mar Saba is a Greek Orthodox monastery overlooking the Kidron Valley in the West Bank east of Bethlehem In Smith published a book in which he wrote that he had discovered a previously unknown letter of Clement of Alexandria c c while cataloging documents there in the summer of Right from the start some scholars voiced the opinion that the letter is not authentic and that it was either an ancient or medieval forgery In Quentin Quesnell published a lengthy article in the Catholic Biblical Quarterly where he even suggested that Smith had forged the document himself and then photographed his alleged forgery An incensed Smith issued a furious rebuttal whereupon Quesnell disclaimed any personal accusations against Smith In in his Strange Tales Per Beskow of Lund cast doubt on the Gospel Smith responded by threatening to sue the publisher Fortress Press of Philadelphia for a million dollars and the publisher amended the offending paragraph Smith is featured discussing the Mar Saba letter in the UK television documentary series Jesus The Evidence Channel Contribution to Old Testament studies Smith s contribution to Old Testament studies was contained in his Palestinian Parties and Politics That Shaped the Old Testament Using form criticism to reconstruct the social background to the Old Testament Smith advanced the proposal that two parties had vied for supremacy in ancient Israel the first composed of those which worshipped many gods of which Yahweh was chief while the other the Yahweh alone faction was largely the party of the priests of Jerusalem who wished to establish a monopoly for Yahweh In monarchic Judah the Yahweh alone party were a permanent minority although sometimes able to win over a king like Josiah to their cause Meanwhile the population at large including most of the kings remained stubbornly polytheistic worshipping the same gods as their neighbours in Moab Ammon etc In the post Exilic period the idea of Yahweh as the only god of Israel finally triumphed but a new division emerged between the separatists who wished the Jews to remain strictly apart from their neighbours this separation being defined in terms of purity and the assimilationists who wished for normal relations with them Ultimately by the late Persian early Hellenistic period the purists won the modern version of the Hebrew Bible was written and a recognisably modern Judaism emerged Smith was admired and feared for his extraordinary ability to look at familiar texts in unfamiliar ways to re open old questions to pose new questions and to demolish received truths He practiced the hermeneutics of suspicion to devastating effect His answers are not always convincing but his questions cannot be ignored Publications Books Tannaitic Parallels to the Gospels The Ancient Greeks Heroes and Gods Spiritual
