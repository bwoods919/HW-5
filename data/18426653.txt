Sheev Palpatine also known by his Sith name Darth Sidious is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas Initially credited as the Emperor in the original trilogy films he serves as the main antagonist of the nine film Skywalker saga in which he is portrayed by Ian McDiarmid In creating Palpatine Lucas was inspired by real world examples of democratic backsliding during the rise and rule of dictators such as Julius Caesar Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler In the original trilogy Palpatine is depicted as the Emperor of the Galactic Empire and the master of Darth Vader Anakin Skywalker In the prequel trilogy Palpatine is portrayed as a charismatic politician and secretly a Sith lord who orchestrates the Clone Wars ends the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic and seduces Skywalker to the dark side of the Force In The Rise of Skywalker the final film in the sequel trilogy Palpatine is revealed to be the mastermind behind the First Order and creator of its puppet leader Snoke as well as the grandfather of protagonist Rey Since the release of Return of the Jedi Palpatine has become a widely recognized symbol of evil in popular culture and since the prequel trilogy a symbol of sinister deception and the subversion of democracy Aside from the films Palpatine appears in various canon and non canon Star Wars media The character recurs throughout the television series Clone Wars The Clone Wars Rebels The Bad Batch Obi Wan Kenobi and Tales of the Jedi all set before the original trilogy Creation and development Concept and writing Star Wars creator George Lucas s conceptualization of Palpatine and the role he plays in the franchise changed over time Lucas s initial notes discuss a line of corrupt emperors not just one In the draft of Star Wars the New Galactic Empire was led by a relatively young human named Cos Dashit The name Palpatine first appears in the prologue of Alan Dean Foster s novelization of the original Star Wars film which detailed the Emperor s rise to power From Return of the Jedi onwards the Emperor became the ultimate personification of evil in the series replacing his apprentice Darth Vader as the central villain Though the films of the original Star Wars trilogy do not actually state the Emperor s name the novelization of Return of the Jedi confirms his name as Palpatine During the story development of The Empire Strikes Back Lucas decided that with the original having only passingly mentioned the Emperor he needed to begin to deal with him on a more concrete level Lucas realized however that the primary conflict with the Emperor would be best saved for the trilogy s third film because w hen you get rid of the Emperor the whole thing is over This influenced the decision to depict the character in a hood so his face would largely be obscured Additionally this look would recall Obi Wan Kenobi Lucas stated that In the end the Emperor does exactly what Obi Wan did he can also transform himself Although Palpatine dies at the end of Return of the Jedi the plot point of his metamorphosis was utilized for the sequel trilogy which Lucas had no direct involvement with Lucas ultimately decided instead to focus on the Emperor in Return of the Jedi In that film the initial conception of Palpatine was superseded by his depiction as a dictatorial ruler adept in the dark side of the Force The Emperor was inspired by the villain Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon comic books The characterization of Palpatine as an ambitious and ruthless politician dismantling a democratic republic to achieve supreme power is in part inspired by the real world examples of democratic backsliding during the rise and rule of Julius Caesar Napoleon Bonaparte Alberto Fujimori Ferdinand Marcos Sr and Adolf Hitler Other elements of the character come from Richard Nixon Lucas said that Nixon s presidency got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships Because the democracies aren t overthrown they re given away Lucas also said The whole point of the movies the underlying element that makes the movies work is that you whether you go backwards or forwards you start out in a democracy and democracy turns into a dictatorship and then the rebels make it back into a democracy Lucas wanted to establish the Emperor as the true source of evil in Star Wars Screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan noted My sense of the relationship between Darth Vader and the Emperor is that the Emperor is much more powerful and that Vader is very much intimidated by him Vader has dignity but the Emperor in Jedi really has all the power He explained that the climax of the film is a confrontation between Vader and his master In the first scene that shows the Emperor he arrives at the Death Star and is greeted by a host of stormtroopers technicians and other personnel Lucas states he wanted it to look like the military parades on May Day in Russia Lucas fleshed out the Emperor in the prequel trilogy According to Lucas Palpatine s role in The Phantom Menace is to explain how Anakin Skywalker later Vader came to be Palpatine s apprentice and the events that sparked Palpatine s rise to totalitarian power after being a senate representative The film s novelization is the first time he is called Darth Sidious His home world Naboo is also home to Anakin s romantic interest Padm Amidala who later becomes a senator of that planet In the Lucasfilm authorized Star Wars and History Palpatine s consolidation of power is described as being similar to the first Roman emperor Augustus Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering the powers of the head of state both pressured the Senate to grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis falsely claiming that they would rescind those powers once the crisis was over and both relied on their strong control over military force Portrayal When the Emperor first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back he was portrayed by Marjorie Eaton under heavy makeup Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed into darkened eye sockets during post production The character was voiced by Clive Revill The makeup was sculpted by Phil Tippett and applied by Rick Baker who initially used his own wife Elaine for the makeup tests With director Irvin Kershner Revill said you had to keep the reins tight you couldn t go overboard It was the perfect example of the old adage less is more the Emperor doesn t say very much But when he finally appears it s at a point in the saga when everyone s waiting to see him It s the Emperor the arch villain of all time and when he says there s a great disturbance in the Force I mean that s enough oomph Years later during production of Revenge of the Sith Lucas decided to shoot new footage for The Empire Strikes Back to create continuity between the prequels and original trilogy Thus in the DVD release of The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition the original version of the Emperor was replaced by Scottish Shakespearean actor Ian McDiarmid and the dialogue between the Emperor and Darth Vader was revised Lucas and director Richard Marquand cast McDiarmid to play Emperor Palpatine for Return of the Jedi He was in his late s and had never played a leading role in a feature film though he had made minor appearances in films like Dragonslayer After Return of the Jedi he resumed stage acting in London In an interview with BackStage McDiarmid revealed that he never had his sights set on a film career and never even auditioned for the role of Palpatine He elaborated I got called in for the interview after a Return of the Jedi casting director saw me perform in the Sam Shepard play Seduced at a studio theatre at the Royal Court I was playing a dying Howard Hughes McDiarmid was surprised when Lucas approached him years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine In an interview he stated When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head and he d clearly just completed three of them McDiarmid added Someone said that Oh I think what he might do next is go back in time and show how Vader came to be It never occurred to me in a million years that I would be involved in that because I thought oh well then he ll get a much younger actor to play Palpatine That would be obvious However I was the right age ironically for the first prequel when it was made So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age having played myself previously when and I don t know what Palpatine s role in the prequel films required McDiarmid to play two dimensions of the same character Recalling the initial days of shooting The Phantom Menace McDiarmid stated Stepping onto the set of Episode I for the first time was like going back in time due to my experience in Jedi Palpatine s an interesting character he s conventional on the outside but demonic on the inside he s on the edge trying to go beyond what s possible McDiarmid added another layer to the character in Attack of the Clones He noted Palpatine is a supreme actor He has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn t behaving in a schizophrenic fashion so he s extra charming or extra professional and for those who are looking for clues that s almost where you can see them McDiarmid illuminated on the scene where Padm Amidala is almost assassinated There s a moment in one scene of the new film where tears almost appear in his eye These are crocodile tears but for all those in the movie and perhaps watching the movie itself they ll see he is apparently moved and of course he is He can just do it He can as it were turn it on And I suppose for him it s also a bit of a turn on the pure exercise of power is what he s all about That s the only thing he s interested in and the only thing that can satisfy him which makes him completely fascinating to play because it is an evil soul He is more evil than the devil At least Satan fell he has a history and it s one of revenge In Revenge of the Sith McDiarmid played a darker interpretation of the character He explained that when you re playing a character of solid blackness that in itself is very interesting in the sense that you have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power It s not so much about not having a moral center it s just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power He admitted I ve been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine and the only one I ve got so far is that he s clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare s Othello Everything he does is an act of pure hypocrisy and that s interesting to play I suppose it s rather like playing Iago All the characters in the play including Othello until the end think that Honest Iago is a decent guy doing his job and he s quite liked But at the same time there s a tremendous evil subconscious in operation McDiarmid noticed that the script for Revenge of the Sith demanded more action from his character than in previous films Lightsaber combat was a challenge to the year old actor who like his costars took fencing lessons The close up shots and non acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid s doubles Michael Byrne Sebastian Dickins and Bob Bowles McDiarmid s performance as Palpatine was generally well received by critics Todd McCarthy of Variety commented Entertaining from start to finish and even enthralling at times Sith has some acting worth writing home about specifically McDiarmid s dominant turn as the mastermind of the evil empire Ed Halter of The Village Voice wrote that Ian McDiarmid s unctuous Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts to draw Anakin into the Sith fold with promises of eternal life Still his performance was not without detractors David Edelstein of Slate critiqued McDiarmid isn t the subtlest of satanic tempters With his lisp and his clammy little leer he looks like an old queen keen on trading an aging butt boy Count Dooku for fresh meat which leaves Anakin looking more and more like a watt bulb McDiarmid had expressed interest in reprising the role of Palpatine in the planned Star Wars Underworld TV series which remains un produced but according to Cory Barlog would have depicted the character as a sympathetic figure who was wronged by this fucking heartless woman She s this hardcore gangster and she just totally destroyed him as a person In the film The Rise of Skywalker McDiarmid returned to the role of Palpatine on screen for the first time since Revenge of the Sith McDiarmid spoke of the process behind Palpatine s first scene in the film the first thing I had to do not everybody has a script was when my voice was off screen as Kylo Ren was coming into my lair So I had this microphone that we called the God mic Yes it means it sounds like God and everyone can hear it in the recording studio in this vast soundstage So everyone there heard my voice come back after all that time and it was a great moment McDiarmid was surprised to learn of the filmmakers decision to bring back Palpatine given the character died in Return of the Jedi The film s director J J Abrams spoke of Palpatine s inclusion in the sequel trilogy when you look at this as nine chapters of a story perhaps the weirder thing would be if Palpatine didn t return You just look at what he talks about who he is how important he is what the story is strangely his absence entirely from the third trilogy would be conspicuous On Palpatine s portrayal in the film McDiarmid said he s fairly physically impaired but his mind is as sharp as ever Make up and costumes Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi required extensive makeup McDiarmid remarked in an interview with Star Wars Insider Yes that was a four hour job initially although we got it down to about two and a half in the end But this was just a little bit of latex here and there a little bit of skin scrunching Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the Emperor looks uncannily like Death in The Seventh Seal and film historian Robin Wood compares him to the hag from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs McDiarmid remarked When my face changes in Revenge of the Sith my mind went back to the early silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney Conversely he required little makeup in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones He recalled I m slightly aged in AotC In the last film I had a fairly standard make up on but now they re starting to crinkle my face Palpatine s wardrobe in the prequels tailored by costume designer Trisha Biggar played an important part in the development of the character In Attack of the Clones explained McDiarmid The costumes have got much more edge to them I think than the mere senator had in The Phantom Menace So we see the trappings of power On Revenge of the Sith McDiarmid said that To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering McDiarmid s favorite costume in the film was a high collared jacket that resembles snake or lizard skin He stated that it just feels reptilian which is exactly right for Palpatine According to Biggar the character s costumes proved the most daunting challenge She said His six costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie He wears greys and browns almost going to black taking him toward the dark side In The Rise of Skywalker Palpatine is unable to move without the aid of a large machine to which he is attached He is depicted as having eyes without pupils and rotting hands Costume designer Michael Kaplan opted to dress Palpatine in a utilitarian black robe which he wears for the majority of the film At the end of the film Palpatine rejuvenates himself using the Force and becomes physically mobile He dons a new costume a formal robe with red velvet which Kaplan refers to as his true Emperor s garb Character overview In the Star Wars fictional universe Palpatine is initially a senator from Naboo presenting himself to the public as a champion of democracy However he is really Darth Sidious a Dark Lord of the Sith who plans to destroy the Jedi and take permanent control of the galaxy As Sidious Palpatine

former master Darth Plagueis using this knowledge to survive after his death in Return of the Jedi The novelization also describes Palpatine s son as a failed clone of himself However the book

intended to be led by his adoptive son Gallius Rax to retreat to the Unknown Regions where they formed into the First Order The dark side was thought to be concentrated in this region where one Sith cultist believed that Palpatine would be found alive The upcoming illustrated book Star Wars The Secrets of the Sith is told from Palpatine s perspective Palpatine appears frequently in the comic book series Darth Vader Dark Lord of the Sith written by Kieron Gillen and Charles Soule It is suggested at the end of the series that Palpatine manipulated the Force to impregnate Vader s mother Shmi Skywalker making him in essence Vader s father although this is left somewhat ambiguous This builds on the plot point of Anakin s virgin birth introduced in The Phantom Menace and the claim that a Sith lord could use the Force to influence the midi chlorians to create life as Palpatine tells Anakin in Revenge of the Sith This would seem to have incestuous implications for Rey and Ben Solo at the end of The Rise of Skywalker but Soule says that The Dark Side is not a reliable narrator and a Lucasfilm story group member who collaborated on the comic confirmed that a direct connection between Palpatine and Vader was not their intent The character also appears in the final chapter of the comic book Star Wars The Rise of Kylo Ren which illustrates Palpatine s manipulation of the young Ben Solo into becoming Kylo Ren Video games Star Wars Battlefront II adds a canonical tale spanning the destruction of the second Death Star through the events of The Force Awakens The story

Star Wars film Aided and abetted by restless power hungry individuals within the government and the massive organs of commerce the ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself to be elected President of the Republic He promised to reunite the disaffected among the people and to restore the remembered glory of the Republic Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor shutting himself away from the populace Soon he was controlled by the very assistants and boot lickers he had appointed to high office and the cries of the people for justice did not reach his ears In Cloak of Deception Luceno writes that Palpatine carefully guards his privacy and others found his reclusiveness intriguing as if he led a secret life Despite this he has many allies in the government Luceno writes What Palpatine lacked in charisma he made up for in candor and it was that directness that had led to his widespread appeal in the senate For in his heart he judged the universe on his own terms with a clear sense of right and wrong In Terry Brooks novelization of The Phantom Menace Palpatine claims to embrace democratic principles He tells Queen Amidala I promise Your Majesty if I am elected chancellor of the Republic I will restore democracy to the Republic I will put an end to the corruption that has plagued the Senate A Visual Dictionary states that he is a self proclaimed savior According to the Star Wars Encyclopedia Palpatine s Empire is based on tyranny Expanded Universe materials explicitly establish that Palpatine was the apprentice of Darth Plagueis Palpatine is characterized as the most powerful practitioner of the Sith ways in modern times Palpatine is so powerful that he is able to mask his true identity from the Jedi for decades In the novel Shatterpoint Mace Windu remarks to Yoda A shame Palpatine can t touch the Force He might have been a fine Jedi The Star Wars Databank explains that the Force granted him inhuman dexterity and speed agility enough to quickly kill three Jedi Masters as depicted in Revenge of the Sith Stover describes the duel between Yoda and Palpatine in his novelization of Revenge of the Sith thus From the shadow of a black wing a small weapon slid into a withered hand and spat a flame colored blade When those blades met it was more than Yoda against Palpatine more the millennia of Sith against the legions of Jedi this was the expression of the fundamental conflict of the universe itself Light against dark Winner takes all During the duel Yoda realizes that Sidious is a superior warrior and represents a small but powerful Sith Order that had changed and evolved over the years while the Jedi had not He had lost before he started He had lost before he was born According to the Databank and New Essential Guide to Characters Palpatine possesses great patience and his maneuverings are as a dejarik grandmaster moves pieces on a board He is depicted as a diabolical genius Palpatine was not given a first name in any canonical or Star Wars Legends sources until when the character s first name Sheev was revealed in the novel Tarkin written by James Luceno The Lucasfilm Story Group approached Del Rey Books and asked if they wanted to use the name which was created by George Lucas in the Tarkin novel to which Del Rey agreed In popular culture With the premiere of Return of the Jedi and the prequel films and the accompanying merchandising campaign Palpatine became an icon in American popular culture Kenner Hasbro produced and marketed a series of action figures of the character from to According to John Shelton Lawrence and Robert Jewett These action figures allow children up to handle the symbols of the Force Academics have debated the relationship of Palpatine to modern culture Religion scholars Ross Shepard Kraemer William Cassidy and Susan Schwartz compare Palpatine and Star Wars heroes to the theological concept of dualism They insist One can certainly picture the evil emperor in Star Wars as Satan complete with his infernal powers leading his faceless minions such as his red robed Imperial Guards Lawrence and Jewett argue that Vader killing Palpatine in Return of the Jedi represented the permanent subduing of evil However according to director J J Abrams Palpatine s return in The Rise of Skywalker represented the idea that evil can return as a result of complacency He said I think the idea that if we are not careful the evil the ultimate evil will rise again Since Return of the Jedi and the prequel films Palpatine s name has been invoked as a caricature in politics A Seattle Post Intelligencer editorial noted that anti pork bloggers were caricaturing West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd as the Emperor Palpatine of pork with Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska having clear aspirations to be his Darth Vader The charge followed a report that linked a secret hold on the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of to the two senators Politicians have made comparisons as well In Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey compared Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee to Palpatine in a speech on the Senate floor complete with a visual aid A Fox News editorial stated no cultural icon can exist without someone trying to stuff it into a political ideology The Star Wars saga the greatest pop culture icon of the last three decades is no exception Palpatine s dissolution of the Senate in favor of imperial rule has been compared to Julius Caesar s marginalization of the Roman Senate Hitler s power grabs as chancellor on his way to becoming a dictator Franklin D Roosevelt s failed court packing scheme and the creation of a perceived Imperial Presidency in the United States On the Internet In the mid late s the character became
