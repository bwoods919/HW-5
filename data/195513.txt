referring specifically to the three prongs or teeth of the weapon The Greek equivalent is tr aina from Proto Greek trianja meaning threefold The Greek term does not imply three of anything specific and is vague about the shape thus the assumption it was originally of trident form has been challenged Latin fuscina also means trident The Sanskrit name for the trident trishula is a compound of tri for three and la for thorn calling the trident s three prongs thorns rather than teeth or dant in Sanskrit making the word Tridant for trident Mythology and art Poseidon The trident is associated with
