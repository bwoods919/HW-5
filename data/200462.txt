The Tasmanian Devil also spelled Tazmanian Devil commonly referred to as Taz is an animated cartoon character featured in the Warner Bros Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons Though the character appeared in only five shorts before Warner Bros Cartoons shut down in marketing and television appearances later propelled Taz to new popularity in the s Personality Taz is generally portrayed as a ferocious albeit dim witted carnivore with a notoriously short temper and little patience He got his name in the short Ducking the Devil where he is described as a vicious evil tempered brute with jaws like a steel trap Though he can be very devious he is also sweet at times His enormous appetite seems to know no bounds as he will eat anything in his path He is best known for his speech consisting mostly of grunts growls and rasps in his earlier appearances he does speak English with primitive grammar as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything Taz does have one weakness he can be calmed by almost any music While in this calm state he can be easily dealt with The only music known not to pacify Taz is the bagpipes which he finds insufferable Creation Robert McKimson designed the character based on the real life Tasmanian devil or more specifically its carnivorous nature voracious appetite and surly disposition Owen and Pemberton suggest that the character of the Tasmanian Devil was inspired by Errol Flynn A later model sheet was created by animator Ted Bonnicksen Appearances In his first appearance in McKimson s Devil May Hare first released on June Taz stalks Bugs Bunny but due to his dimwittedness and inability to frame complete sentences he serves as little more than a nuisance Bugs eventually gets rid of him in the most logical way possible matching him up with an equally insatiable Tasmanian She Devil The character s speech a deep gravelly voice peppered with growls screeches and raspberries is provided by Mel Blanc Only occasionally would Taz actually speak usually to utter some incongruous punchline e g What for you bury me in the cold cold ground and yet the character is capable of writing and reading A running gag is that when Bugs Bunny hears of the approach of Taz looks him up in an encyclopedia and starts reading off a list of animals that Taz eats which is pretty much everything that exists including people Bugs finds rabbits not listed until Taz enters and either points out that rabbits are listed or writes rabbits on the list After the film short debuted at theaters producer Edward Selzer head of the Warner Bros animation studio ordered McKimson to shelve the character feeling that he was too violent for children and that parents would dislike him After a time with no new Taz shorts studio head Jack L Warner asked what had happened to the character Warner saved Taz s career when he told Selzer that he had received boxes and boxes of letters from people who liked the character and wanted to see more of him McKimson would go on to direct four more Taz cartoons beginning with Bedevilled Rabbit released on April McKimson would also pair the Devil with Daffy Duck in Ducking the Devil August before pitting him once again against Bugs in Bill of Hare June and Dr Devil and Mr Hare March His last two appearances done by the classic Warner Brothers
