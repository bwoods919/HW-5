Sex robots or sexbots are anthropomorphic robotic sex dolls that have a humanoid form human like movement or behavior and some degree of artificial intelligence As of although elaborately instrumented sex dolls have been created by a number of inventors no fully animated sex robots yet exist Simple devices have been created which can speak make facial expressions or respond to touch There is controversy as to whether developing them would be morally justifiable In Robot ethicist Kathleen Richardson called for a ban on the creation of anthropomorphic sex robots with concerns about normalizing relationships with machines and reinforcing female dehumanization Questions about their ethics effects and possible legal regulations have been discussed since then Lexicology People who are sexually attracted to sexbots are sometimes referred to as digisexuals or robosexuals Sexbots with a male shape design may be referred to as malebots or manbots Gender neutral terms for sex robots include pleasure bot or sex droid Sexbots with a female shape design have been referred to as chick bots or fembots History and development The sex robot has evolved from sex doll precursors that stem back as far as the th century during which French and Spanish sailors created hand sewn masturbation puppets made of cloth leather and old clothes Many scholars consider this creation to be the direct predecessor of modern sex dolls Much of the inspiration for creating the modern sex doll came from mannequin based art created by Hans Bellmer Man Ray and Salvador Dal Man Ray claimed that surrealists including himself and Dal infused their work with eroticism and personally violated their mannequins For example Dal s Rainy Taxi centered on a female mannequin whose half undressed body was crawling with live snails By inflatable dolls were first advertised in pornographic magazines and became available for purchase via mail These sex dolls were inflatable with air consisting of penetration areas at the mouth vagina and anus However due to their inflatable nature these dolls were subject to deterioration and were not sustainable for constant use By the s materials such as latex and silicone were widely used in the manufacturing of sex dolls to facilitate enhanced durability and a greater resemblance to a human The realism of sex dolls greatly accelerated in the late s In Matt McMullen began constructing lifelike tin cured silicone rubber mannequins called RealDolls that were realistic posable and life sized McMullen received much criticism about the anatomical correctness of his mannequins using this as motivation to create a more enhanced version In McMullen switched to using platinum cured material instead of tin cured silicone to further enhance the durability and lifelike nature of the doll Consequently all other sex doll manufacturers have followed suit Many manufacturers including Matt McMullen believed that companionship is a critical part of the sexbot dynamic and that incorporating artificial intelligence AI into them is the next step As of various new models have been constructed to hold conversations remember important facts and express various emotions One such model is Harmony created by McMullen which is customizable by using a mobile app where users can choose from thousands of possible combinations of looks clothes personalities and voices to make your perfect companion State of research Sex robots are still in a relatively early stage of development While sex dolls have been available on the market for more than years and there are accordingly established doll owner communities available for research experienced users of sex robots are hardly to be found so far Nevertheless the topic of sex robots has been treated quite intensively in international research since triggered by David Levy s monograph Love and Sex With Robots A systematic research review from the year was able to identify international academic publications on sex robots These academic sex robot publications focus on the following six research questions What are the appropriate theoretical conceptualizations of sex robots What are the main ethical aspects of sex robots What empirical findings on the use and effects of sex robots are available How are sex robots represented in art and media How should child sex robots be regulated legally What are the appropriate designs and design processes for sex robots The majority of the available academic sex robot publications deals with ethical aspects focusing on both currently available sex robots that have only very limited artificial intelligence and interactivity and future sex robots that are envisioned as being sentient and having a free will While at least some findings on experienced users are available on sex dolls corresponding empirical data on sex robot users are missing The academic sex robot discourse is similar to the public discourse so far characterized by relatively striking ideas about strong positive or strong negative effects of sex robots Weak as well as ambivalent effects which are theoretically and empirically most probable are rarely discussed Likewise sex robots are often regarded and criticized as predetermined products Rarely is it considered in the state of research so far that the appearance as well as the functions and target groups of sex robots can be actively designed for example by and for women queer people older people or people with disabilities Those human centered design processes can be the subject of academic sex robot research as well The sex robot research community meets at the International Love and Sex With Robots Conference series initiated by David Levy held for the sixth time in as the th International Congress on Love Sex with Robots Predictions In David Levy a chess champion and the author of Love and Sex with Robots said in an interview with Newsweek that I believe that loving sex robots will be a great boon to society There are millions of people out there who for one reason or another cannot establish good relationships He estimates that this will take place by the mid st century In MIT Press published the first book on this topic Robot Sex with a preliminary approach to the several challenges this field represents for human beings and societies Claimed potential benefits Scholars such as Hojjat Abdollahi argue that these robots can act as robot companions that aid elderly people with dementia or depression After conducting a study on many elderly patients it was found that elderly individuals were interested in having an intimate robot as their companion and their interest did not decay over time He further explains that these patients established meaningful rapport with the robot companion and that they greatly valued its presence Bioethicist Nancy S Jecker also suggests that older people with disabilities lose their sexual functioning because of physical changes due to aging and disease but also because of social stigma and scorn Jecker argues that these robots are a way to support dignity and continue the ability to be sexual by dispelling ageism and negative stereotypes about later life sexuality The robot companion Paro created by Takanori Shibata has been used since as a therapeutic machine for the elderly suffering with dementia as well as those suffering from depression and anxiety Paro is designed to respond to touch remember faces and learn certain actions that promote a favorable reaction in the patient Although Paro was not designed to be a sex robot specifically Paro is an example of how intelligent machines could become a suitable therapeutic option Some manufacturers have also argued that their introductions into prisons may reduce prison rape and sexual tension in prison Prison inmates suffer from both separation from their partners and the limited possibility of gaining such a partner in prison and they often turn to sexual harassment and the threat of rape as a result Scholars like Oliver Bendel suggest that sex robots could be the solution to establishing sexual health and diminishing sexual tensions beyond in prison Manufacturers have also suggested sex robots may alleviate sexlessness in encumbered professions such as long haul truck drivers or all male oil rigs Sex robots can also help avoid problems of unwanted pregnancies sexually transmitted diseases and sexual violence which would be issues in brothels and with prostitutes Attempts at realization There are ongoing attempts to make sex dolls socially interactive In a sex doll called Roxxxy that had the capacity to play back pre recorded speech cues was demonstrated at a trade show In Matt McMullen the creator of the RealDoll stated that he intended to create intelligent sex dolls with the capacity to hold conversations Barcelona based Dr Sergi Santos developed a sex robot named Samantha the robot can switch between a sex mode which can include Samantha simulating a female orgasm and a family mode in which it can also can tell jokes and discuss philosophy In Matt McMullen created a sex doll called Harmony which has the capability of learning about the personal preferences wants and desires of the owner Furthermore Harmony can smile blink and frown in a nearly human like fashion She can hold a conversation tell jokes remember food preferences and the names of the owner s siblings The cost of Harmony is said to be roughly During an onstage interview with Engadget in Matt McMullen demonstrated that the skin on Harmony s face could be peeled off and replaced with different skin He subsequently added a different colored wig and changed her personality by using the app on his handheld device that controls the robot He named this sex doll Solana and considers it to be the sister of Harmony Also in Chinese company AI Tech released a sex robot named Emma that could talk in both English and Chinese Emma has built in sensors that cause it to moan when touched and can be heated to a human body temperature The robot also uses AI so that the more you interact with her the cleverer she will become in responding Other companies such as Doll Sweet Lux Botics MISSDOLL and Eden Robotics are in the process of developing sex robots with automated movements Using animatronics Roberto Cardenas an entrepreneur for Eden Robotics claims that his Android Love Dolls are capable of placing themselves in different sex positions with the help of AI body movement Current sex robots on the market are not able to perform any full body movements In Realbotix the company behind the RealDoll announced the creation of the first ever male sex bot Henry Henry will have a customizable bionic penis will be able to go as long as you want as it plugs into electricity instead of using batteries Buyers will also be able to order a customizable robotic head that can be controlled by an app on the user s phone Opposition In September Kathleen Richardson of De Montfort University and Erik Billing of the University of Sk vde created the Campaign Against Sex Robots calling for a ban on the creation of anthropomorphic sex robots Richardson is critical of David Levy and argues that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful and demeaning to women and children In September the Japanese company Softbank the makers of the Pepper robot included a ban on robot sex The robot s user agreement states The policy owner must not perform any sexual act or other indecent behaviour Noel Sharkey Aimee van Wynsberghe and Eleanor Hancock of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics released a consultation report presenting a summary of the issues and various opinions about what could be society s intimate association with robots The report includes an examination of how such robots could be employed as a rehabilitative tool for sex criminals such as serial rapists or pedophiles Sharkey warns that this could be problematic in terms of sex dolls resembling children and adolescents There is considerable speculation about such technology coming from experts in the fields of philosophy sociology and the natural sciences John P Sullins of Sonoma State University believes that sex robots will facilitate social isolation and Lydia Kaye of Central Saint Martins argue that sexual relations with robots will desensitize humans to intimacy and empathy Furthermore according to Chauntelle Tibbals nothing can replace the joy sorrow passion and pain of an actual unpredictable human interaction She further argues that only when interacting with another human can we experience our humanity and our identity as opposed to interacting with a robot The sex robots that have been created as of primarily resemble women with exaggeratedly hyperfeminine features In Barcelona a sex doll brothel allows men to act out their fantasies where they can choose from a selection of flexible silicone dolls and request that they be dressed in whatever outfit the man prefers Kathleen Richardson argues that these sex robots facilitate a powerful attitude towards women s bodies as commodities and promote a non empathetic interaction Experts argue that improving the gender diversity of those involved in developing this sex technology could help reduce possible harm such as the objectification of women Many scholars including Richardson argue that this reinforces the idea that women are property rather than human beings with free will Scholars such as Robert Sparrow from Monash University argue that the creation of realistic female sex robots with the ability to refuse consent further facilitates a rape culture He believes that sex with these robots represents the rape of a woman and may increase the rate of rape in society while also facilitating a general disrespect for women in society Furthermore a sex robot called Frigid Farah whose personality is described as reserved and shy has caught the attention of several scholars The manufacturer claimed that if you touch her in a private area more than likely she will not be too appreciative of your advance Many scholars view this as indulging rape fantasies and facilitating a rape culture Legislation The Curbing Realistic Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic Robots CREEPER Act sponsored by Daniel M Donovan Jr was passed by the U S House of Representatives on June The bill would amend the federal obscenity statute U S C to criminalize importation and transportation for interstate commerce any anatomically correct doll mannequin or robot with the features of or with features that resemble those of a minor intended for use in sexual acts Bob Goodlatte stated that these dolls create a real risk of reinforcing pedophilic behavior and they desensitize the user causing him to engage in sicker and sicker behavior Australia and the United Kingdom already have such bans Critics of the bill argue that it is unconstitutional and or unnecessary The bill is said to have died in the senate in Vern Buchanan is said to reintroduce an amended version of the bill in Philosophical discussion The First International Congress on Love and Sex with Robots was held in Funchal Madeira in November The conference was coordinated by Professor Adrian David Cheok and Dr David Levy The main discussion revolved around the debate of where to draw the line with regard to cybernetic love and relationships and what the future of love and sex with robots has in store Additional topics of discussion during the conference included humanoid robots robot emotions roboethics and philosophical approaches In October a second conference scheduled for November in Malaysia was declared illegal by the Malaysian Inspector General of Police The second conference was eventually held in the United Kingdom in December chaired by Dr Kate Devlin at Goldsmiths University of London Devlin also founded the UK s first ever sex tech hackathon also held in at Goldsmiths In a discussion of these issues was held at the th IFIP TC Human Choice Computers Conference entitled Technology and Intimacy Choice or Coercion The conference was coordinated by Dr David Kreps from Salford University The overall aim of the conference was to scrutinize the journey from impersonal monolithic technology towards the intimate intertwining of devices and the self A prospective outlook on how these technologies will evolve was closely examined Some of the main themes discussed during the conference were intimacy personalization material culture and sexual relationships with robots In September the th IFIP TC Human Choice Computers Conference This Changes Everything was held in Poznan Poland The conference was led and directed by David Kreps Kai Kimppa Louise Leenen and Charles Ess The discussion was focused on the societal and ethical implications posed by artificial intelligence privacy concerns and how such technologies have significantly shifted computational strategies and altered the world people live in In popular culture Intimacy with robots artificial intelligence and other human constructed items are saturated in the media landscape They provoke questions about what love is why people crave the need for affection and challenge pre existing beliefs of what it means to be human Originally published in the novel Tomorrow s Eve centers around a fictionalized Thomas Edison who creates a female robot for his lonely patron While the robot s beauty is apparent the robot lacks the emotional capabilities to fulfill that hole in his heart Fritz Lang s film Metropolis contains the robot Maria as a central figure who is portrayed as sexually alluring In Fritz Leiber s novel The Silver Eggheads non sentient female sexbots were known to exist They would do whatever sex act was asked of them as long as money inserted into a slot at the back of the neck held out Several episodes of the s television show Star Trek The Original Series featured female androids as companions of the protagonist notably Andrea from the episode What Are Little Girls Made Of and Rayna Kapec from the episode Requiem for Methuselah Due to television censorship of the time sexuality is only alluded to although Nurse Christine Chapel referred to Andrea as a mechanical geisha Both episodes employ the plot device of having the android struggle to comprehend and come to terms with human emotion Further in the episode I Mudd several series of female robots were created to the personal specifications of Harcourt Fenton Mudd The Alice series at least according to Alice are programmed to function as human females having been so programmed by that unprincipled evil minded lecherous kulak Harry Mudd The Michael Crichton movie Westworld featured android prostitutes at Miss Carrie s place In addition there were basic sex model female robots programmed not to resist a guest s seduction in Roman World and Medieval World and male equivalents in Roman World were referred to Further specific robots could be programmed for certain sexual behaviors At one point the Queen in Medieval World is programmed for infidelity to tie into a guest s desire for his vacation Ridley Scott s film Blade Runner depicts the android characters Pris Rachel and Zhora as having been manufactured to be sexually alluring Pris in particular is referred to as a basic pleasure model The post apocalyptic movie Cherry is built around the quest of the protagonist to locate a Cherry model gynoid robot into which he can install the memory disk of his wife a destroyed Cherry gynoid thus recreating her The film A I Artificial Intelligence has a male sex robot Gigolo Joe as a main character Joe describes that humans love what robots do for them but cannot love them since they are not flesh and blood and in the end hate them A Gigolo Jane female model also briefly appears in the film Two androids with sexual abilities appeared in episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer In I Was Made to Love You Warren Mears builds a fembot girlfriend but after acquiring a human girlfriend discovers that dumping the droid is more difficult than he anticipated In Intervention Spike takes delivery of his own personal Buffybot also built by Mears As implied by actions and dialogue in the episode the Buffybot as built is a sexbot Futurama has two episodes involving robots and organic beings I Dated a Robot and Proposition Infinity The film Lars and the Real Girl explores the idea of a romantic attachment to artificial human like items Ultimately the film concludes with the protagonist murdering his sex doll lover in a river emphasizing the projection of one s idealized lover onto an inanimate object The film Ex Machina questions common notions about consciousness A sentient female robot is created with a violent outcome rebelling against her creators Throughout the story Ex Machina appears to empathize with the robot as a victim of a man with a god complex Responding to the protagonist s uncertainty about her fate if she does not live up to her creator s standards the robot Ava responds Why is it up to anyone about whether or not she lives This questions the audience s underlying belief about whether or not a robot is entitled to a free life like other conscious beings In the British series Humans there are both male and female courtesan synths the series name for androids The synths that have achieved human consciousness cannot be told from human beings In the TV series Westworld realistic interactive robots part of a theme park engage in sexual and other activity with guests The satirical dystopian fiction novel Ride Sally Ride by Douglas Wilson centers on the cultural impact of charging a man with murder for destroying a sex robot which was claimed to be a legal spouse by its owner See also Agalmatophilia Gynoid Joe s Garage Proposition Infinity Robot fetishism Sex machine Social robot Teledildonics References Further
