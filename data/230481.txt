with rescuing a foreign cabinet minister and his aide from insurgents in an unspecified South American country CIA officer Al Dillon a Vietnam War buddy of Dutch s is assigned to accompany the team over Dutch s objections En route the team discovers the wreckage of a helicopter and three skinned corpses Dutch identifies them as Green Berets that he knew and becomes suspicious of Dillon s intentions The team reaches the guerilla camp and witnesses the execution of a hostage They mount an attack killing most of the rebels and several Soviet intelligence officers Dutch confronts Dillon who reveals their true mission was to stop a planned Soviet backed invasion and that the CIA sent the Green Berets weeks earlier for the same mission The only surviving guerilla Anna is captured Learning that more rebels are coming the team chooses to trek to the extraction point They are followed by an entity employing a cloaking device and thermal imaging technology but a spooked Billy glimpses it creating a situation where Anna attempts an escape Hawkins catches her but the creature attacks and kills him while sparing Anna Dutch organizes a search party but Blain is killed by the creature s plasma cannon Enraged Mac provokes everyone to blindly fire their weapons into the jungle unknowingly wounding the creature As the creature administers first aid to itself the commandos regroup and realize they are being hunted Dillon believes two or three guerrillas are responsible but Billy is adamant that their pursuer is not human They make camp for the night and set traps which are triggered by a wild boar In the confusion Mac kills it while the creature steals Blain s body Dutch later realizes that their enemy uses the trees to travel and frees Anna who states that her people had seen similarly mutilated bodies before The next day the group constructs a net trap and captures the creature but it frees itself and Poncho is injured Mac and Dillon pursue it but are outmaneuvered and killed As the survivors flee Billy stays behind to fight the creature The creature kills Billy before following the survivors and killing Poncho Realizing it does not attack unarmed individuals Dutch tells the unarmed Anna to get to the chopper Dutch attempts to distract the creature by fleeing but is followed to a muddy riverbank and covered in mud The creature fails to see him and leaves to collect trophies from the others Dutch realizes the cool mud provided camouflage for his body heat He crafts makeshift traps and weapons and lures the creature out at night with a war cry and torch Dutch lightly injures the creature and disables its cloaking device as the creature fires wildly into the forest and tries to escape but accidentally falls into the river where the water dissolves his muddy camouflage As the creature corners Dutch it removes its mask and plasma cannon to fight him hand to hand having deemed him a worthy opponent Despite being overpowered and outsmarted Dutch attempts to goad the creature into a booby trap It goes around but Dutch triggers the trap anyway crushing the creature with the trap s counterweight With the alien mortally wounded he asks it What the hell are you The creature repeats the question back to Dutch and activates its self destruct device maniacally laughing as it counts down Upon realizing what it has done Dutch runs for cover and survives the explosion He is then rescued by the extraction helicopter with Anna already safely on board though he is left traumatized by the experience Cast Production Development Following the release of Rocky IV a joke circulated in Hollywood that since Rocky Balboa had run out of earthly opponents he would have to fight an alien if a fifth film were to be made Screenwriters Jim and John Thomas took the inspiration from the joke and wrote a screenplay based on it The Thomas script for Predator was originally titled Hunter The original concept centered on a plot of what it is to be hunted concerned a band of alien hunters of various species seeking various targets that concept was eventually streamlined to one extraterrestrial hunting the most dangerous species humans and the most dangerous man a combat soldier Additionally the setting was chosen as Central America for having constant special forces operations during that period As the Thomas brothers were first time screenwriters with little credibility in Hollywood they struggled to attract attention for their proposed film and eventually resorted to slipping the script under the door of th Century Fox producer Michael Levy who would go on to serve as executive producer on the film s sequel Predator Levy then brought the screenplay to producer Joel Silver who based on his experience with Commando decided to turn the science fiction pulp story line into a big budget film Silver enlisted his former boss Lawrence Gordon as co producer and John McTiernan was hired as director for his first studio film At one point New Zealand director Geoff Murphy was also considered to direct Casting Silver and Gordon first approached Arnold Schwarzenegger with the lead role Schwarzenegger said The first thing I look for in a script is a good idea a majority of scripts are rip offs of other movies People think they can become successful overnight They sat down one weekend and wrote a script because they read that Stallone did that with Rocky Predator was one of the scripts I read and it bothered me in one way It was just me and the alien So we re did the whole thing so that it was a team of commandos and then I liked the idea I thought it would make a much more effective movie and be much more believable I liked the idea of starting out with an action adventure but then coming in with some horror and science fiction He had previously starred in Commando on which Silver had served as producer To play the elite band of soldiers both Silver and Gordon with co producer John Davis searched for other larger than life men of action Carl Weathers who had been memorable as boxer Apollo Creed in the Rocky films was their first choice to play Dillon while professional wrestler and former Navy SEAL Jesse Ventura was hired for his formidable physique as Blain co starring with Schwarzenegger the same year in The Running Man Also cast were Sonny Landham Richard Chaves and Bill Duke who costarred alongside Schwarzenegger in Commando Jean Claude Van Damme was originally cast as the Predator with the intent that the physical action star would use his martial arts skills to make the Predator an agile ninja like hunter But when the Van Damme was compared to Schwarzenegger Weathers and Ventura actors over feet tall and known for their bodybuilding regimens it became apparent a more physically imposing man was needed to make the creature appear threatening Additionally it was reported that Van Damme constantly complained about the monster suit being too hot and causing him to pass out He allegedly had also repeatedly voiced reservations about only appearing on camera in the suit Additionally the original design for the Predator was felt to be too cumbersome and difficult to manage in the jungle and even with a more imposing actor did not provoke enough fear Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by the Kevin Peter Hall who had just finished work as a sasquatch in Harry and the Hendersons Filming Commitments by Schwarzenegger delayed the start of filming by several months The delay gave Silver enough time to secure a minor rewrite from screenwriter David Peoples Principal photography eventually began in the jungles of Palenque Chiapas Mexico during the last week of March but most of the film was shot in Mismaloya Mexico Much of the material dealing with the unit s deployment in the jungle was completed in a few short weeks and both Silver and Gordon were pleased by the dailies provided by McTiernan On Friday April production halted so that Schwarzenegger could get to his wedding on time flying to Hyannis Port in a Learjet chartered by Silver Schwarzenegger was married on April to Maria Shriver and honeymooned for only three days while the second unit completed additional filming The production resumed filming on May and ended in late June Both McTiernan and Schwarzenegger lost pounds during the film Schwarzenegger s weight loss was a professional choice while McTiernan lost the weight because he avoided the food in Mexico due to health concerns Unlike McTiernan most of the cast and crew suffered from Travelers diarrhea s since the Mexican hotel in which they were living had problems with its water purification In an interview Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up as early as a m to work out before the day s shooting Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him and would work out only after the other actors were nowhere to be seen According to Schwarzenegger filming was physically demanding The actor and former bodybuilder shipped gym equipment to Mexico and trained intensively every day before shooting began usually with his co stars Screenwriter Jim Thomas was impressed with the training regimen and said I think that phrase manly men was coined during the production of Predator Among other tasks Schwarzenegger had to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien In addition cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required heat lamps to be on all of the time Cast and crew filmed on rough terrain that according to the actor was never flat always on a hill We stood all day long on a hill one leg down one leg up It was terrible Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with Kevin Peter Hall who could not see in the Predator suit The actor recalled that when he s supposed to slap me around and stay far from my face all of a sudden whap There is this hand with claws on it Hall stated in an interview that his experience on the film wasn t a movie it was a survival story for all of us For example in the scene where the Predator chases Dutch the water was foul stagnant and full of leeches Hall could not see out of the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and memorize where everything was The outfit was difficult to wear because it was heavy and affected his balance Visual effects The original Predator creature was created by Richard Edlund of Boss Film Studios and was a disproportionate ungainly creature with large yellow eyes and a dog like head and nowhere near as agile as necessary for what the filmmakers had intended After a call was put out for a new alien creature costume creature effects artist Rick Baker put in a bid but ultimately McTiernan consulted Stan Winston Winston had previously worked with Schwarzenegger as a visual effects artist on the film The Terminator While on a plane ride to Fox studios alongside Aliens director James Cameron Winston sketched monster ideas Cameron suggested he had always wanted to see a creature with mandibles which became part of the Predator s iconic look R Greenberg Associates created the film s optical effects including the alien s ability to become invisible its thermal vision point of view its glowing blood and the electrical spark effects The invisibility effect was achieved by having someone wearing a bright red suit because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and the blue of the sky the size of the Predator The red was removed with chroma key techniques leaving an empty area The take was then repeated without the actors using a wider lens on the camera When the two takes were combined optically the jungle from the second take filled in the empty area Because the second take was filmed with a wider lens a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape For thermal vision infrared film could not be used because it did not register in the range of body temperature wavelengths The filmmakers used an Inframetrics thermal video scanner because it gave good heat images of objects and people The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from glow sticks mixed with personal lubricant for texture The electrical sparks were rotoscoped animation using white paper pins registered on portable light tables to black and white prints of the film frames The drawings were composited by the optical crew for the finished effects Additional visual effects mainly for the opening title sequence of the Predator arriving on Earth were supplied by Dream Quest Images later Oscar winners for their work on The Abyss and Total Recall The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects Music The score was composed by Alan Silvestri who was coming off the huge success of Back to the Future in Predator was his first major action movie and the score is full of his familiar genre characteristics heavy horn blasts staccato string rhythms and undulating timpani rolls that highlight the action and suspense Little Richard s song Long Tall Sally is featured in the helicopter en route to the jungle Mac also recites a few lines from the song as he s chasing the Predator after it escapes from their booby trap Silvestri returned for the sequel making him the only composer to have scored more than one film in either the Alien or Predator series In Var se Sarabande released the soundtrack album as part of its limited release CD Club collection the album also includes the Elliot Goldenthal arrangement of the th Century Fox fanfare used on Alien In Brian Tyler adapted and composed some of Silvestri s themes used in the score of the film Aliens vs Predator Requiem In the same year Predators featured an adaptation of Silvestri s score by John Debney Intrada Records released the album in a copy limited edition with remastered sound many cues combined and renamed and most notably as with Intrada s release of Basil Poledouris s score for RoboCop presenting the original end credits music as recorded the film versions are mixed differently This release is notable for having sold out within a day In Henry Jackman adapted and composed Silvestri s themes in the score of the film The Predator Release Home media Predator was first released on VHS on January It was later released on DVD on December The film was later released on Blu ray on April It was released on Blu ray D on December and on Ultra HD Blu ray on August

calendar year The film grossed of which was from the US Canadian box office was made in other countries Critical response From contemporary reviews Janet Maslin of The New York Times described the film as grisly and dull with few surprises Dean Lamanna wrote in Cinefantastique that the militarized monster movie tires under its own derivative weight Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times proclaimed it arguably one of the emptiest feeblest most derivative scripts ever made as a major studio movie Variety wrote that the film was a slightly above average actioner that tries to compensate for tissue thin plot with ever more grisly death sequences and impressive special effects Adam Barker of The Monthly Film Bulletin found that unfortunately special effects have also been substituted for suspense and that the early appearance of the Predator makes the final gladiatorial conflict predictable and the monster s multiple transformations also exhaust interest in its final appearance Though finding the creature s motivations poorly explained critic Roger Ebert was more complimentary of the film He wrote Predator moves at a breakneck pace it has strong and simple characterizations it has good location photography and terrific special effects and it supplies what it claims to supply an effective action movie The Hollywood Reporter s Duane Byrge felt the Predator s weaponized attacks relied too heavily on special effects but allowed that the film is a well made old style assault movie and a full assault visual experience Chris Hewitt of Empire wrote Predator has gradually become a sci fi and action classic It s not difficult to see why John McTiernan s direction is claustrophobic fluid and assured staging the action with aplomb but concentrating just as much on tension and atmosphere A thumping piece of powerhouse cinema Peter Suderman of Reason magazine noted that over the last odd years it has come to be regarded a classic of s action cinema Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale Legacy Predator has appeared on a number of best of lists In C Robert Cargill of RealNetworks resource Film com now merged into MTV Movies ranked Predator as the seventh best film of calling it one of the great science fiction horror films often imitated but never properly duplicated not even by its own sequel Entertainment Weekly named it the nd greatest action movie of all time in and the th among The Best Rock em Sock em Movies of the Past Years in saying Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been as manly as he was in this alien hunting testosterone fest In IGN proclaimed it the th greatest action movie of all time In Empire magazine ranked it th on their list of The Greatest Movies of All Time Predator was ranked th in a Rolling Stone reader poll of the all time best action films it was described by reporter Andy Greene as freakin awesome In a review for IGN William Bibbiani called Predator The most subversive action movie of the s and cites examples from the film of satire of the action film genre as a whole In his review he writes Predator may be a big macho action movie but it s also highly critical of the kinds of characters you d normally find in big macho action movies and the superficial unquestioningly heroic stories they appear in The line Get to the choppa was subsequently associated with Arnold Schwarzenegger especially when Schwarzenegger said the line again in some of his later appearances including The New Celebrity Apprentice and advertisements for the mobile video game Mobile Strike Lieutenant Andrew Pierce Christian Boeving s leading hero from the action film When Eagles Strike was based on Schwarzenegger s image in the film In NECA released action figure collectables of Major Dutch and the Predator That same year Predator was converted into D for a Blu ray release The Predator makes an appearance in Tom Clancy s Ghost Recon Wildlands in a bonus mission called The Hunt In the Predator was featured in the video game Fortnite as a cosmetic outfit for the character and a hidden enemy in the game the first of which gave players the associated abilities such as invisibility and the shoulder cannon The film inspired Ander Monson s book Predator A Memoir a Movie an Obsession Academy Award nomination When it came time to recognize the Predator with an Academy Award nomination the combination of techniques used had the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences officials unsure as to which category the Predator belonged The mechanical features of the character s head suggested the makeup effects category but due to the camouflage effect there was a visual effects aspect to the character as well Ultimately Stan Winston was nominated for an Oscar for Predator in the Best Visual Effects category just as he had been for Aliens but he and his co nominees lost to the effects team from Innerspace Though in the same year the academy had categorized the Predator creature as a visual effect it honored Rick Baker with an Oscar in the Best Makeup category for his work on Harry and the Hendersons This was despite the fact that Harry had been achieved in exactly the same way that the Predator had with a performer wearing a suit and a mechanical head In fact the same actor Kevin Peter Hall had performed in both suits Other media Merchandise The success of Predator resulted in numerous novels comic books video games and toys Sequels The success of Predator led th Century Fox to finance three direct sequels over the next thirty one years each by different directors starting with Predator released in Arnold Schwarzenegger has not reprised his role as Dutch Schaefer in the subsequent sequels he had been made offers to return but declined on all
