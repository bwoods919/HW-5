overpowering smaller ones These qualities became more apparent in transition where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets Around this time James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing

garners from opposing defenses James creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists He executes unconventional passes including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters Early in James s career he was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games however as his career progressed James s clutch performance was viewed more favorably Defense At the beginning of James s NBA career he was considered a poor defensive player but he improved steadily through the years In
