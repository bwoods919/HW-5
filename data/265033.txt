respectively aired on television and featured Michael Jordan with the character Bugs Bunny Wieden Kennedy creative director Jim Riswold conceived the Hare Jordan campaign following the popularity of advertisements where Jordan played with Mars Blackmon played by Spike Lee a character from She s Gotta Have It he chose Bugs Bunny for his next campaign because the character was his childhood hero Directed by Joe Pytka Hare Jordan took six months and a million budget to make It was hindered by reluctance from Warner Bros to allow Nike to modernize Bugs character however the commercial success of both ads was a nice bit of research for Warner Bros to understand that the Bugs character still had relevance and to tie it in with Michael explained Pytka This led to the company green lighting a film featuring Jordan and Bugs which came out of a plane meeting between a Nike executive and producer Ivan Reitman Jordan was offered movie deals previously but his manager David Falk turned them all down because he felt the basketball icon could only act as himself The project was closed when Jordan retired from basketball in only to be reopened in when Jordan returned as a basketball player Falk pitched the idea to several major studios without a story or script written One of them was Warner Bros which tried to create more adult sophisticated material that deviated from the formula set by Disney in the animated film market After Warner Bros initially rejected Falk s pitch he called the consumer products division leader Dan Romanelli reacting in surprise the studio would turn down a project having potential of high selling merchandise Pytka was informed about the project only months before the start of principal photography in addition to being hired as director he also revised the script including writing a scene where Jordan hits a home run after he returns to Earth that was filmed but ultimately never used Spike Lee was also interested in helping Pytka with the screenplay but Warner Bros blocked him from the project out of dissatisfaction from how he funded Malcolm X Casting According to Pytka it was difficult to get most actors involved with Space Jam due to its odd premise I mean they re going to work with an animated character and an athlete are you serious They just didn t want to do it Before Wayne Knight was cast as Stan his initial choices were Michael J Fox and Chevy Chase whom he had worked with on Doritos commercials Warner Bros rejected both actors Jason Alexander also turned down the role There were also attempts to replace Jordan s character with a more experienced actor but we couldn t find anyone better The easiest actors to obtain were the NBA players except for Gheorghe Mure an Bill Murray s appearance was present in the script from the beginning but the filmmakers were unable to book him until filming started there are rumors that Jordan begged Murray to be in the film Reitman serious about the voice actors for the established Looney Tunes characters being far better than their original voice actor Mel Blanc and not just replications was very involved in the voice casting Joe Alaskey one of Blanc s successors since the latter s death was put by Reitman through a set of auditions which lasted for months until Alaskey grew tired of auditioning and backed out from the project Billy West learned of Space Jam through Reitman on The Howard Stern Show who was producing Stern s film Private Parts Reitman was impressed by West s voice talent and asked him if he could audition for Space Jam West accepted and after doing an audition he landed the roles of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd The casting directors originally planned several voice cameos however that did not work out and Danny DeVito ended up being the only celebrity voice actor in the film which was for Mr Swackhammer who was originally planned to be played by Jack Palance Swackhammer was also planned to be a live action character until the very final days of development with Dennis Hopper possibly playing the role due to his friendship with Pytka One thing I heard was that Ivan Reitman when they were thinking about going ahead with this movie had phoned up Robert Zemeckis about Who Framed Roger Rabbit and asked Do you have any advice on what we should do to make a movie like this And he said Don t do it it nearly killed me Scale The Classic Animation faction of Warner Bros which animated the commercials and was located in Sherman Oaks Los Angeles was originally planned to be the only company responsible for Space Jam However after only a week the animation work was so complicated that Warner Bros contacted more studios including reassigning the Feature Animation division in Glendale from working on Quest for Camelot to Space Jam Ten of Classic Animation s members including the production s animation director Tony Cervone were taken out of the faction to become involved all throughout production and development artists were reassigned to animating jobs including supervising animator Bruce Woodside who had little faith in the project Like so many other animators I adore the classic Warner Bros characters but I really had little hope that tying them to the massive anchor of an apparently doomed marketing scheme could actually give them a successful second life in features After Cervone was hired as animation director Jerry Rees contacted Bruce W Smith about being another animation director on the film Rees was fired by the time Smith joined and Pykta hired Smith to direct the animation sequences alongside Cervone Before January when animation production was put into overdrive none of the animators drafts or concepts for how the film should look met with Reitman s approval Bill Perkins joined that month as animation art director and when first arriving at the Sherman Oaks division we only had around eight months to do about minutes of animation and it was just kind of a little skeleton crew Cervone highlighted Reitman s role as supervisor It started off as a string of gags with no structure and he helped a lot with that The drafting process involved the animators and artists using the original cartoons as references Ultimately they went with Bob Clampett s style of animation due to being wilder than Chuck Jones style Production of Space Jam totaled around months with filming taking up ten of them this was half the time of any other film of its kind according to Smith The animation was done at a very quick pace by more than workers from studios in London Canada California and Ohio starting January by the recently joined producers Ron Tippe and Allison Abbate In trying to track the huge amount work done at the studios Tippe hung stills of all the shots throughout the Feature Animation faction s hallways with completed ones marked in red Features about the film s production including one from the official website emphasized its state of the art computer technology when it came to its live action animation hybrid this film could have not been made two years ago claimed Cervone in Due to its mixture of various art mediums as well as the broad sense of humor and entertainment unique to the Looney Tunes Smith considered Space Jam an important part of diversifying the animation industry Space Jam broke the record for amount of composited shots in a featured film roughly according to Tippe as well as a record number of FX shots with around in a single minute film Independence Day released the same year had FX shots within two hours of screen time Tippe claimed the film would have at most multiple characters multiple levels of effects and in some cases up to elements in one shot Filming Space Jam was one of the first ever productions to be shot on a virtual studio Jordan filmed in a degree green screen room with motion trackers around him were green suited NBA players and improv actors from the Groundlings Theatre and School serving as placement identifiers for the animated characters with a CGI background replica of a real life setting chroma keyed in Although Bill Murray initially came in only to work on the golf course scene he then wanted to be in the climactic basketball game after Pytka showed him the process of how he directed the live action animation scenes Concept drawings and discussions between the animators and Pytka about how the animation would be incorporated into the live action shots took place on set during shooting and re writes to the script would be done daily As an experienced commercial and music video director working on a sports film Pytka took on fast unlimited camera movements and Dutch angles this made integrating the characters into the shots challenging for the animators To connect the real and animated worlds together blue screen shots of miniatures by Vision Crew Unlimited were used these include a Christo inspired interpretation of The Forum arena for exterior shots city rooftops for a transition scene with a wide skyline view of Chicago serving as the chroma keyed background and space ship parts initially produced by Boss Film Studios for a Philip Morris advertisement Music The soundtrack sold enough albums to be certified as times Platinum The song I Believe I Can Fly by musical artist R Kelly earned him three Grammy Awards Other tracks included a cover of Steve Miller Band s Fly Like an Eagle by Seal Hit Em High The Monstars Anthem by B Real Busta Rhymes Coolio LL Cool J and Method Man Basketball Jones by Barry White Chris Rock Pump up the Jam by Technotronic I Turn to You by All One and For You I Will by Monica The film s title song was performed by the Quad City DJ s There was also an original scoring soundtrack featuring most of James Newton Howard s score from the film except the main Merrie Melodies Theme itself Coincidentally Biz Markie who was a guest vocalist on the Spin Doctors s cover of KC The Sunshine Band s That s the Way I Like It on the soundtrack died from complications from type diabetes on the release date of the sequel Animation and design Technology Space Jam was one of the earliest animated productions to use digital technology D animation and backgrounds were first done on paper with pencil at the Sherman Oaks studio before being scanned into Silicon Graphics Image files through Cambridge Animation Systems software Animo and were then sent to Cinesite via a File Transfer Protocol for its team to touch upon digitally color and composite into shots in Photoshop before being sent back to Sherman Oaks Unlike previous projects that used the Cineon digital film system Cinesite used the quicker Inferno and Flame systems for Space Jam The film s Holly render farm consisted of central processing units four gigabytes of shared memory and took up one million dollars of the film s budget on top of which the deskside boxes had megabytes of RAM to splurge on whatever scene you needed to create and render explained Privett Cinesite had begun developing proprietary software for motion tracking when working on Under Siege Dark Territory which involved most of its shots incorporating a digital background this made the company prepared for Space Jam which consists of a bunch of moving camera shots with D backgrounds to be added The CGI backgrounds moved around with the motion trackers via Cinesite s proprietary software Ball Buster which identified the markers through algorithm To avoid mistakes in the visuals as much as possible Cinesite artists worked on the film by frame instead of viewing each shot as a whole those such as Jonathan Privett were dissatisfied with the method primarily because it put them under much pressure We much preferred the good old fashioned run at fps just as the viewer sees it approach Backgrounds The design of the stadium was heavily dictated by that of the film s many characters and it was such a long process that it went through revisions explained Cinesite digital effects supervisor Carlos Arguello Tasmanian Devil was brown so we couldn t have a wooden brown upper level and there were so many colorful characters and Michael Jordan and everybody had to look good in all the scenes For scenes that take place in the stadium shortcuts were made For crane shots of the crowd of people in the final basketball sequence it was created with live action extras cloned animated crowd members and a few computer generated characters walking around the aisles in the stadium When these shots involved camera movements a few D extras were animated to reflect the angle of the camera but much lighting was added to distract from the crowd thus minimizing this work The reflections of the floor on the gym were also fake d as raytracing would ve meant rendering it for four days per a few frames Characters Abbate suggested the hurried workflow of the animators bled into the character animation resulting in a quick witted style the Looney Tunes cartoons are most known for Although the animators had to work with almost characters they were the most focused on Bugs and Daffy not only because they were principal characters but also because they were the most recognizable Warner Bros characters to general audiences Sculpting was incorporated the most on Bugs and Lola including in beauty shots or sequences where Bugs and Lola are together Perkins conceived the idea of the villains being secondary colors as the main Looney Tunes were either primary colors black or brown There was also a lot of experimentation with motion blur with the D characters especially Tweety as Simon Eves explained The workflow was that an artist would track some specific points on the sequence of D character on black that came from the animation house and I think it was able to take a basic roto shape as well and then it would generate an interpolated motion vector field which could be applied as a variable directional blur The field would deform based on the relative motion of the tracking points on the camera to produce more accurate blur as the character deformed Release Warner Bros released Space Jam through its Family Entertainment division on November Box office Space Jam grossed million in the United States and million in other territories for a worldwide total of million Domestically it debuted to million from theaters topping the box office The film then made

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Sun Times and Chicago Tribune both gave Space Jam a thumbs up although Siskel s praise was more reserved In his review Ebert gave the film three and a half stars and noted Space Jam is a happy marriage of good ideas three films for the price of one giving us a comic treatment of the career adventures of Michael Jordan crossed with a Looney Tunes cartoon and some showbiz warfare the result is delightful a family movie in the best sense which means the adults will enjoy it too Siskel focused much of his praise on Jordan s performance saying He wisely accepted as a first movie a script that builds nicely on his genial personality in an assortment of TV ads The sound bites are just a little longer Leonard Maltin also gave the film a positive review three stars stating that Jordan is very engaging the vintage characters perform admirably and the computer generated special effects are a collective knockout Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film for its humor as well as the Looney Tunes antics and Jordan s acting Although Janet Maslin of The New York Times criticized the film s animation she later went on to say that the film is a fond tribute to the Looney Tunes characters past Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune complained about some aspects of the movie stating we don t get the co stars best stuff Michael doesn t soar enough The Looney Tunes don t pulverize us the way they did when Chuck Jones Friz Freleng or Bob Clampett were in charge Yet overall he also liked the film giving it stars and saying Is it cute Yes Is it a crowd pleaser Yup Is it classic Nope Though it could have been TV Guide gave the movie only two stars calling it a cynical attempt to cash in on the popularity of Warner Bros cartoon characters and basketball player Michael Jordan inspired by a Nike commercial Margaret A McGurk of The Cincinnati Enquirer gave the film stars out of four writing Technical spectacle amounts to nothing without a good story Veteran Looney Tunes director Chuck Jones was critical of the film and its premise opining
