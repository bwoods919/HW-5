Nemesis Inspired by these Stoklasa created his review for Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace citing his dislike of the franchise s prequel trilogy and how it influenced a trend of films

stated that in creating a review he and a friend would watch the film only once while taking notes and frequently pausing the film to discuss scenes After that he would write a page script for it in the Plinkett character voice it and edit it together along with some improvisations Half in the Bag Half in the Bag is a regularly released series in which Stoklasa and Bauman review films in a more traditional format albeit with a haphazard and fourth wall breaking overarching plot Stoklasa has described it as a cross between Siskel and Ebert and a s sitcom with Stoklasa and Bauman playing VCR

participants then individually decide upon which film or video represents the Best of the Worst Viewing material that is deemed to be insulting offensive or especially poor is often destroyed in a creative fashion Methods of destruction have included dissolving a VHS tape in acetone forcing a DVD through a paper shredder dragging a tape around the streets tied to the bumper of a car and cooking

Gillian Bellinger and indie film auteur Len Kabasinski Some episodes feature the Wheel of the Worst in which a wheel is spun to select which films videos will be watched Wheel selections are often videos that are either extremely bizarre such as Dog Sitter a movie made to appeal to dogs low budget instructional films educational films and those which have little modern relevance such as Chinese language instructional tapes about how to use AOL Videos featured on Wheel of the Worst are most frequently found on VHS tapes The Daily Herald praised Best of the Worst for being Red Letter Media s most entertaining series The show occasionally features other gimmicks to randomly select viewing material such as the Choose And Lose and the Plinketto Board Another subsection of Best of the Worst includes the Black Spine Edition where the group randomly selects VHS tapes which are missing informational or identification labels on the side of the cassette Sometimes the crew will review a specific film which they have previously viewed off camera and recommend to fans of poorly conceived and poorly executed B movies They refer to reviews of this nature as their Spotlight Series The

well as a vinyl LP of Meredith Monk s Turtle Dreams and a bobblehead statue of Kevin from the Home Alone series signed by frequent guest Macaulay Culkin re View On May the company released the first episode of a new series called re View Compared to the company s other shows the format is a much more stripped down and straight forward approach to film critique Two members of Red Letter Media sit in front of a red curtain and offer thoughts and insight on a film that they both enjoy Films chosen for this feature are often either cult classics such as Pink Flamingos Freddy Got Fingered and Martin or well renowned genre defining films like The Thing and Ghostbusters Clips of the film being discussed are interwoven typically to lend emphasis to a specific point being made or to showcase some of the most memorable moments from the film re View has also featured Star Trek films and episodes a particular favorite of Stoklasa s For an episode featuring The Guest the screenwriter of the film Simon Barrett appeared as a guest and spoke about many behind the scenes aspects of the production A similar insight into the background of a film the Red Letter Media crew enjoyed was shared in a two part interview series with Samurai Cop lead Matt Hannon though this occurred prior to the creation of the re View branding and format Former child star Macaulay Culkin made a guest appearance in a episode reviewing Hackers and has since returned to both this series and Best of the Worst Previously Recorded In July Red Letter Media affiliates Rich Evans and Jack Packard began a YouTube Video

the duo announced that they would be broadcasting their final live stream on July and then the channel would be put on hold for the foreseeable future afterwards The Nerd Crew A Pop Culture Podcast The first episode being uploaded to YouTube on January The Nerd Crew parodied pop culture fanboyism and video series such as Screen Junkies Collider and The John Campea Show with Stoklasa Bauman and Evans playing manchildren demonstrating excessive enthusiasm over Star Wars the Marvel Cinematic Universe the DC Extended Universe and other content aimed primarily at a juvenile audience Product placement native advertising and general subservience to entertainment mega corporations were all satirized Films Red Letter Media also produces original feature length films Among the low budget features Stoklasa and Bauman have produced and directed on Red Letter Media are the action comedy film Oranges Revenge of the Eggplant made in and available on Netflix currently only available for DVD rental not for streaming The Recovered a horror thriller starring Tina Krause and Feeding Frenzy a genre spoof of puppet monster movies like Gremlins Feeding Frenzy featured Rich Evans as Mr Plinkett Evans originated the character in short films and this feature was filmed before the popularity of the Phantom Menace review Stoklasa s short films are usually dark comedies Plinkett played by Evans appeared in several of them starting with You re Invited Stoklasa created and starred in five seasons of the web sitcom The Grabowskis opposite Dixie Jacobs about an exaggeratedly trashy and unpleasant sitcom family Installments of the series were only a few seconds long at first comically giving more screen time to the lengthy intro than the episode itself but grew to full episode length over time On October the company announced via a short video that it had completed the feature length film Space Cop which had been in production for at least seven years Space Cop stars Evans in the titular role alongside Stoklasa who wrote and co directed the film with Bauman It was made available on January on Blu ray for through Red Letter Media s Bandcamp page The first run sold out in a matter of hours Commentary tracks Since Red Letter Media has produced commentary tracks for various films releasing them on Bandcamp These began with three commentary tracks by Stoklasa as Mr Plinkett but the company has since released tracks by Stoklasa Bauman and Evans as themselves Nukie VHS auction The company collected Nukie VHS tapes for nearly a decade after fans began mailing them copies of the film However they never watched the film until December when they released a special episode about the practice of grading VHS tapes following reports that a VHS copy of Back to the Future sold for They had one Nukie tape professionally graded while the others over tapes were destroyed using a woodchipper to inflate the graded tape s value The graded tape was then put up for auction on eBay ultimately selling for This set a record for the most expensive VHS tape sold of all time Proceeds from the auction were donated to the Wisconsin Humane Society and St Jude Children s Research Hospital with the donation to the Wisconsin Humane Society being the largest donation in the organization s history The ethics regarding the destruction of the other tapes to raise the price of the auction inspired debate on social media Reception Stoklasa s Mr Plinkett reviews have been considered part of an emerging art form that hybridizes mashup with video essays as they use a combination of footage from the movie in question and other related sources Literary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that Plinkett enacts a kind of d tournement by recontextualizing images that would otherwise serve as Star Wars marketing material such as behind the scenes footage and interviews Defined by Guy Debord as the reuse of preexisting artistic elements in a new ensemble d tournement is a way of generating meaning out of cultural texts that is antithetical to their original intent Kirbach argues that Stoklasa uses this tactic to construct a subversive narrative that frames George Lucas as a lazy out of touch and thoroughly unchallenged filmmaker Kirbach also argues that Plinkett s popularity can be explained in part as a form of catharsis Because he is portrayed as insane the Plinkett shtick legitimates our nerd rage by literalizing it Plinkett enrolls George Lucas in an ongoing Oedipal drama as the castrating father figure a father figure we are invited to rage against owing to his flagrant ineptitude But aside from raw catharsis Kirbach claims that Plinkett s insanity is also a critique of the film industry itself By fictionalizing his critic Stoklasa constructs a character who is unable to speak at a safe distance from the text he analyzes Plinkett becomes the figure of a consumer culture that has been force fed Hollywood schlock beyond its carrying capacity Kirbach writes And further Stoklasa s major conceit that someone would have to be crazy to watch movies the way Plinkett does also implies a barely hidden inverse that the film industry has induced a consumerist fantasy in people who don t watch movies this way Plinkett s obscenity and jokiness are without a doubt designed to garner viewership but they are also Stoklasa s apology for or defense against a culture that already construes his level of passion as pathological This central irony leads us to question what is actually more insane the consumer who rejects the expressions of a massive culture industry or the massive culture industry itself Plinkett satirizes the kind of consumer such a system generates psychotic sexist homicidal In an interview with Esquire comedian Patton Oswalt noted that the Mr Plinkett reviews are an example of amazing film scholarship on the Star Wars prequels that demonstrate how much of the Star Wars universe is squandered by them The Daily Telegraph called the reviews legendary and described them as being more popular than the actual films Director Jordan Vogt Roberts whilst critiquing CinemaSins Everything Wrong With video of his film Kong Skull Island for bad film criticism masked under the guise of satire praised Red Letter Media for good film criticism and satire stating that Red Letter Media s Phantom Menace review IS satire They lampoon a certain type of nerd culture AND their takedown is accurate thoughtful Red Letter Media s critiques hold up under scrutiny CinemaSins just wants to shit on things for the sake of shitting on them However the reviews have also been criticized by Star Wars fans Stoklasa stated that he feels Star Wars to some people is like a religion so they respond to attacks on it as such One fan wrote a page long point by point response to the Phantom Menace review taking issue with many of Stoklasa s criticisms which Stoklasa mocked in an announcement video for his Revenge of the Sith review Filmography
