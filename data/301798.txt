Harry aims his revolver and reprises his ultimatum about losing count of his shots Scorpio reaches for his gun but Harry shoots and kills him with his last bullet and removes his police badge throws it in the nearby water and walks away Cast Production Development The script titled Dead Right by the husband and wife team of Harry Julian Fink and Rita M Fink was originally about a hard edged New York City police inspector Harry Callahan who is determined to stop Travis a serial killer even if he has to skirt the law and accepted standards of policing blurring the distinction between criminal and cop to address the question as to how far a free democratic society can go to protect itself The original draft ended with a police sniper instead of Callahan shooting Scorpio Another earlier version of the story was set in Seattle Washington Four more drafts of the script were written Although Dirty Harry is arguably Clint Eastwood s signature role he was not a top contender for the part The role of Harry Callahan was offered to John Wayne and Frank Sinatra and later to Robert Mitchum Steve McQueen and Burt Lancaster In his interview with Playboy George C Scott claimed that he was initially offered the role but the script s violent nature led him to turn it down When producer Jennings Lang initially could not find an actor to take the role of Callahan he sold the film rights to ABC Television Although ABC wanted to turn it into a television film the amount of violence in the script was deemed excessive for television so the rights were sold to Warner Bros Warner Bros purchased the script with a view to casting Frank Sinatra in the lead Sinatra was at the time and since the character of Harry Callahan was originally written as a man in his mid to late s and Eastwood was then only Sinatra fit the character profile Initially Warner Bros wanted either Sydney Pollack or Irvin Kershner to direct Kershner was eventually hired when Sinatra was attached to the title role but when Sinatra eventually left the film so did Kershner John Milius was asked to work on the script when Sinatra was attached along with Kershner as director Milius claimed he was requested to write the screenplay for Sinatra in three weeks Terrence Malick wrote a draft of the film dated November in which the shooter also named Travis was a vigilante who killed wealthy criminals who had escaped justice Details about the film were first released in film industry trade papers in April After Sinatra left the project the producers started to consider younger actors for the role Burt Lancaster turned down the lead role because he strongly disagreed with the violent end justifies the means moral of the story He believed the role and plot contradicted his belief in collective responsibility for criminal and social justice and the protection of individual rights Marlon Brando was considered for the role but was never formally approached Both Steve McQueen and Paul Newman turned down the role McQueen refused to make another cop movie after Bullitt Believing the character was too right wing for him Newman suggested that the film would be a good vehicle for Eastwood The screenplay was initially brought to Eastwood s attention around by Jennings Lang Warner Bros offered him the part while still in post production for his directorial debut film Play Misty for Me By December a Warner Bros studio press release announced that Clint Eastwood would star in as well as produce the film through his company Malpaso Eastwood was given a number of scripts but he ultimately reverted to the original as the best vehicle for him In a MTV interview Eastwood said So I said I ll do it but since they had initially talked to me there had been all these rewrites I said I m only interested in the original script Looking back on the Don Siegel film he remembered The rewrites had changed everything They had Marine snipers coming on in the end And I said No This is losing the point of the whole story of the guy chasing the killer down It s becoming an extravaganza that s losing its character They said OK do what you want So we went and made it Scorpio was loosely based on the real life Zodiac Killer an unidentified serial killer who had committed five murders in the San Francisco Bay Area several years earlier Elements of Gary Steven Krist were also worked into the characterization as Scorpio like Krist kidnaps a young girl and buries her alive while demanding ransom In a later novelization of the film Scorpio was referred to as Charles Davis a former mental patient from Springfield Massachusetts who murdered his grandparents as a teenager There are significant differences between the book and the film Among the differences are Scorpio s point of view in the book he uses astrology to make decisions including being inspired to abduct Ann Mary Deacon Harry working on a murder case involving a mugger before he is assigned to Scorpio the omission of the suicide jumper and Harry throwing away his badge at the end Audie Murphy was initially considered to play Scorpio but he died in a plane crash before his decision on the offer could be made When Kershner and Sinatra were still attached to the project James Caan was under consideration for the role of Scorpio The part eventually went to a relatively unknown actor Andy Robinson Eastwood had seen Robinson in a play called Subject to Fits and recommended him for the role of Scorpio his unkempt appearance fit the bill for a psychologically unbalanced hippie Siegel told Robinson that he cast him in the role of the Scorpio killer because he wanted someone with a face like a choirboy Robinson s portrayal was so memorable that after the film was released he was reported to have received several death threats and was forced to get an unlisted telephone number In real life Robinson is a pacifist who deplores the use of firearms Early in principal photography on the film Robinson would reportedly flinch in discomfort every time he was required to use a gun As a result Siegel was forced to halt production briefly and sent Robinson for brief training in order to learn how to fire a gun convincingly Milius says his main contribution to the film was a lot of guns And the attitude of Dirty Harry being a cop who was ruthless I think it s fairly obvious if you look at the rest of my work what parts are mine The cop being the same as the killer except he has a badge And being lonely I wanted it to be like Stray Dog I was thinking in terms of Kurosawa s detective films He added In my script version there s just more outrageous Milius crap where I had the killer in the bus with a flamethrower I tried to make the guy as outrageous as possible I had him get a police photographer to take a picture of him with all the kids lined up at the school he kidnaps them at the school actually and they showed the picture to the other police after he s made his demands he wants a to take him away to a country where he ll be free of police harassment Milius laughs uproariously terrible things like this And the children all end up like a graduation picture and the teacher is saying What is that object under Andy Robinson and a cop says That s a claymore mine Teacher asks What s a claymore mine And we hear the voice of Harry say If he sets it off they re all spaghetti Chief says That s enough Harry Everybody said That s too much John we can t have Milius doing this kind of stuff I wanted the guy to be just totally outrageous all the time and he is I think Siegel restrained it enough Screenwriter John Milius owns one of the actual Model s used in principal photography in Dirty Harry and Magnum Force As of March it is on loan to the National Firearms Museum in Fairfax Virginia and is in the Hollywood Guns display in the William B Ruger Gallery Principal photography Glenn Wright Eastwood s costume designer since Rawhide was responsible for creating Callahan s distinctive old fashioned brown and yellow checked jacket to emphasize his strong values in pursuing crime Filming for Dirty Harry began in April and involved some risky stunts with much footage shot at night and filming the city of San Francisco aerially a technique for which the film series is renowned Eastwood performed the stunt in which he jumps onto the roof of the hijacked school bus from a bridge without a stunt double His face is clearly visible throughout the shot Eastwood also directed the suicide jumper scene The line My that s a big one spoken by Scorpio when Callahan removes his gun was an ad lib by Robinson The crew broke into laughter as a result of the double entendre and the scene had to be re shot but the line stayed The final scene in which Callahan throws his badge into the water is supposedly an homage to a similar scene from s High Noon Eastwood initially did not want to toss the badge believing it indicated that Callahan was quitting the police department Siegel argued that tossing the badge was instead Callahan s indication of casting away the inefficiency of the police force s rules and bureaucracy Although Eastwood was able to convince Siegel not to have Callahan toss the badge when the scene was filmed Eastwood changed his mind and went with Siegel s preferred ending Filming locations One evening Eastwood and Siegel had been watching the San Francisco ers in Kezar Stadium in the last game of the season and thought the eerie Greek amphitheater like setting would be an excellent location for shooting one of the scenes

reception The film caused controversy when it was released sparking debate over issues ranging from police brutality to victims rights and the nature of law enforcement At the th Academy Awards feminists protested outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion holding up banners which read messages such as Dirty Harry is a Rotten Pig Also Andy Robinson s portrayal as the Scorpio Killer was so convincing that he received death threats after the film s release Jay Cocks of Time praised Eastwood s performance as Dirty Harry describing him as giving his best performance so far tense tough full of implicit identification with his character Neal Gabler also praised Eastwood s performance in the film There s an incredible pleasure in watching Clint Eastwood do what he does and he does it so well Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four calling it very effective at the level of a thriller but denouncing its moral position as fascist Gene Siskel gave the film a full four out of four stars and praised it as one of the great police thrillers of motion picture history though he too thought that the film s message was dangerous Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote that what makes Dirty Harry worth watching no matter how dumb the story is Siegel s superb sense of the city not as a place of moods but as a theater for action Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it a high style film with lowbrow appeal a movie after which you may dislike yourself for liking it as much as you do Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic described Dirty Harry as disgusting Siegel was largely unbothered by the film s critics stating I enjoy the controversy because if you make a film that s safe you re in trouble I m a liberal I lean to the left Clint is a conservative he leans to the right At no point in making the film did we ever talk politics I don t make political movies I was telling the story of a hard nosed cop and a dangerous killer What my liberal friends did not grasp was that the cop is just as evil in his way as the sniper Since its release the film s critical reputation has grown in stature Dirty Harry was selected in by Empire as one of The Greatest Movies of All Time It was placed similarly on The Best Movies Ever Made list by The New York Times In January Total Film included the film on its list of The Greatest Movies of All

critics indicating universal acclaim In Time Out polled several film critics directors actors and stunt actors to list their top action films Dirty Harry was listed at th place in this list John Milius later said he loved the film I think it s a great film one of the few recent great films more important than The Godfather It s larger than the sum of its parts I don t think it s so

kidnapping In October soon after the release of the movie in Australia two armed men one of whom coincidentally had the last name Eastwood kidnapped a teacher and six school children in Victoria They demanded a million ransom The state government agreed to pay but the children managed to escape and the kidnappers were subsequently jailed Frederick Newhall Woods IV was inspired by the film to plan the Chowchilla kidnapping in which a bus with twenty six schoolchildren and its driver were kidnapped and buried in a van in a rock quarry in Livermore California The students and driver escaped before the kidnappers could send their ransom demand In September a case occurred in Germany under circumstances quite similar to the Barbara Mackle kidnapping A ten year old girl Ursula Herrmann was buried alive in a box fitted with ventilation lighting and sanitary systems to be held for ransom The girl suffocated in her prison within hours of her abduction because autumn leaves had clogged up the ventilation duct Twenty seven years later a couple were arrested and tried for kidnapping and murder on circumstantial evidence This case was also dealt with in the German TV series Aktenzeichen XY ungel st Influence Eastwood s iconic portrayal of the blunt cynical unorthodox detective who is seemingly in perpetual trouble with his incompetent bosses set the style for a number of his later

success of Dirty Harry led to the production of four sequels In the film Zodiac also set in San Francisco and inspired by the Zodiac Killer cartoonist Robert Graysmith approaches police detective Dave Toschi at a movie theater where he is watching Dirty Harry with his wife When Graysmith tells Toschi he is going to catch the Zodiac killer Toschi replies Pal They re already making movies about it
