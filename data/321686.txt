A m nage trois French mena a t w is a domestic arrangement and committed relationship with three people in polyamorous romantic or sexual relations with each other and often dwelling together typically a traditional marriage between a man and woman along with another individual The phrase is a loan from French meaning household of three Contemporary arrangements are sometimes identified as a throuple thruple or triad Terminology This relationship type has elements of bisexuality involved but occasionally at least one of the participants is heterosexual Because this term is sometimes interchangeably used for a threesome which solely refers to a sexual experience involving three people it can sometimes be misrepresented as some type of perversion or casual encounter However the m nage trois is a specific type of committed relationship in which vows are often made It does not apply to all polyamorous relationships with three individuals since polyamory can have many different forms The topic sometimes overlaps seemingly opposing concepts such as Christian feminism and Lesbian feminism These ideas were explored by film maker Angel Robinson in her film Professor Marston and the Wonder Women through the love story of historical couple William Moulton Marston and Elizabeth Holloway Marston with their research assistant Olive Byrne Both the term and way of life have become a topic of discussion in areas associated with Christendom and Romance languages Examples Ancient history Biblical This relationship type is very much rooted in the traditional marriage ideas of the Abrahamic faiths Christian views on marriage are prevalent in literature and media discussing this topic The patriarchs Abraham and Sarah had an arrangement similar to a m nage trois with Sarah s handmaiden Hagar Interpretations of this vary for example Judaism and Islam treat it much more like a polygamous situation whereas Christian sources sometimes discuss the love triangle aspect of it which are not directly analogous with a m nage trois Similarly when Jacob married Leah and Rachel the polygamy and love triangle angles are far more well researched than as a m nage trois Christianity
