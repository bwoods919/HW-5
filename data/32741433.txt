Dragons was on CBR s Best Comic Books Graphic Novels Any D D Player Should Read list the article states it s a issue comic book series that unfortunately got canceled Don t be put off by that though Fell s Five is highly rated and features interesting characters each complementing and opposing the other making them a dysfunctional party that somehow still works and gets through the skin of their teeth In his review of the ongoing Dungeons Dragons series Chris Sims for ComicsAlliance wrote that John Rogers has devoted the book not just to a great fantasy storyline but some of the strongest and most engaging character work I ve seen in a while The amazing thing is that Adric Fell and his crew are actually good characters in their own right while still being completely believable as being the inhabitants of a world build entirely on the rigid arcane rules that govern a roleplaying game It s unbelievably tricky to pull both of those off at once but Rogers does it It s all stuff that fans of D D and the fantasy literature it draws inspiration from are all familiar with but the way they interact with each other makes it feel fresh and fun and it s perfectly complimented sic by Di Vito s expressive art In short it s the story of the best D D campaign ever as played by the group I wish I was a part of Reviews of Dungeons Dragons Days of Endless Adventure which collects the Legends of Baldur s Gate Shadows of the Vampire and Frost Giant s Fury trades were generally positive SJ Twining for Screen Rant wrote Days of Endless Adventure is the perfect illustrated introduction to the world s greatest roleplaying game Legends of Baldur s Gate faithfully recreates the Forgotten Realms in continuity and detail drawing upon the legendary campaign setting s lore and adapting it with aspects highlighted in Dungeons Dragons th Edition Gavin Sheehan for Bleeding Cool wrote in his review You re getting issues total with nearly three years worth of storytelling Each set serves a very specific purpose in the canon of the characters you re introduced to The first set brings about proper introductions and forming up the party of characters and dealing with a crisis the second set gives you a familiar villain to Dungeons Dragons lore and the third quite frankly goes off the rails on purpose with an insane adventure that few mortals would ever dare tread into The back of the book features a mix of official artwork from Dungeons Dragons various adventure books and promotional material as well as alternative artwork for certain scenes and even a few sketches of the characters as you can see the work that went into making them come to life You also get character sheets for all five of the main party characters Its a slice of something different that doesn t read like other adventure comics out there which fits perfectly with the motif of the tabletop RPG franchise it s based on Collected editions The series has been collected in the following trade paperbacks
