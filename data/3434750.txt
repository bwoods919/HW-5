and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council The U S is the foremost military power in the world and a dominant political cultural and scientific force internationally Etymology The first documentary evidence of the phrase United States of America dates back to a letter from January written by Stephen Moylan to Joseph Reed George Washington s aide de camp Moylan expressed his wish to go with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort The first known publication of the phrase United States of America was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg on April By June the name United States of America had appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union prepared by John Dickinson and of the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson A citizen of the United States is called an American United States American and U S refer to the country adjectivally American values U S forces The word American rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States History Beginnings before It is generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least years ago however some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival The Clovis culture which appeared around BC is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America later waves brought the ancestors of present day Athabaskans Aleuts and Eskimos Over time indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated and some such as the pre Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast developed advanced agriculture architecture and complex societies The city state of Cahokia is the largest most complex pre Columbian archaeological site in the modern day United States In the Four Corners region Ancestral Puebloan culture developed from centuries of agricultural experimentation The Algonquian are one of the most populous and widespread North American indigenous peoples This grouping consists of the peoples who speak Algonquian languages Historically these peoples were prominent along the Atlantic Coast and into the interior along the Saint Lawrence River and around the Great Lakes Before Europeans came into contact most Algonquian settlements lived by hunting and fishing although many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn beans and squash the Three Sisters The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice The Haudenosaunee confederation of the Iroquois located in the southern Great Lakes region was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries Estimating the native population of North America during European contact is difficult Douglas H Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution estimated a population of in the South Atlantic states and a population of in the Gulf states but most academics regard this figure as too low Anthropologist Henry F Dobyns believed the populations were much higher suggesting around million along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico million people living between Florida and Massachusetts million in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries and around people in the Florida peninsula The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sent by France to the New World in encountered Native American inhabitants of what is now called New York Bay The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine often considered the nation s oldest city and Santa Fe The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico notably New Orleans and Mobile Colonization settlement and communities Successful English colonization of the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in at Jamestown and with the Pilgrims colony at Plymouth in The continent s first elected legislative assembly Virginia s House of Burgesses was founded in Harvard College was established in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in as the first institution of higher education The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who came seeking religious freedom The native population of America declined after European arrival for various reasons primarily from diseases such as smallpox and measles By the mid s the British had defeated and seized the territory of Dutch settlers in New Netherland in the mid Atlantic region In the early days of colonization many European settlers experienced food shortages disease and conflicts with Native Americans such as in King Philip s War Native Americans were also often fighting neighboring tribes and European settlers In many cases the natives and settlers came to depend on each other Settlers traded for food and animal pelts natives for guns tools and other European goods American Indians taught many settlers to cultivate corn beans and other foodstuffs European missionaries and others felt it was important to civilize the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles However with the increased European colonization of North America Native Americans were displaced and often killed during conflicts European settlers also began trafficking African slaves into Colonial America via the transatlantic slave trade By the turn of the th century slavery had supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the American South Colonial society was divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and several colonies passed acts for or against the practice The Thirteen Colonies that would become the United States of America were administered by the British as overseas dependencies All nonetheless had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and Catholics in some areas With very high birth rates low death rates and steady settlement the colonial population grew rapidly eclipsing Native American populations The Christian revivalist movement of the s and s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest both in religion and in religious liberty Excluding the Native Americans who lived there the Thirteen Colonies had a population of over million in about a third that of Britain Despite continuing new arrivals the rate of natural increase was such that by the s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas The colonies distance from Britain had allowed the development of self government but their unprecedented success motivated British monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority Revolution and the new nation The American Revolution separated the Thirteen Colonies from the British Empire and ensuing American Revolutionary War represented the first successful war of independence by a non European entity against a European power in modern history By the th century the American Enlightenment and the political philosophies of liberalism were pervasive among leaders Americans developed an ideology of republicanism asserting that government s authority rested on the consent of the governed They demanded their rights as Englishmen and no taxation without representation The British insisted on administering the colonies through a Parliament that did not have a single representative responsible for any American constituency and the conflict escalated into war In the First Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia passed the Continental Association which mandated a colony wide boycott of British goods The American Revolutionary War began the following year The Second Continental Congress an assembly representing the United Colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July annually celebrated as Independence Day The Declaration stated We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness Stephen Lucas called it one of the best known sentences in the English language with historian Joseph Ellis writing that the document contains the most potent and consequential words in American history During the British Colonial era slavery was legal in all of the American colonies composed a longstanding institution in world history and challenges to its moral legitimacy were rare However during the Revolution many in the colonies began to question the practice In the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until In the American victory at the Battle of Saratoga resulted in the capture of a British army and led to France and their ally Spain joining in the war against them After the surrender of a second British army at the siege of Yorktown in Britain signed a peace treaty American sovereignty became internationally recognized and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River from what is present day Canada in the north and Florida in the south As it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of where the United States Constitution was authored and ratified in state conventions in The U S Constitution is the oldest and longest standing written and codified national constitution in force today Going into force in it reorganized the government into a federation administered by three branches executive judicial and legislative on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances George Washington who had led the Continental Army to victory and then willingly relinquished power was the first President elected under the new constitution The Bill of Rights forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections was adopted in The Louisiana Purchase almost doubled the nation s area Tensions with Britain remained leading to the War of which was fought to a draw Spain ceded Florida and other Gulf Coast territory in Expansion and reform Regional divisions over slavery grew in the ensuing decades In the North several prominent Founding Fathers such as John Adams Roger Sherman Alexander Hamilton John Jay and Benjamin Franklin advocated for the abolition of slavery and by the s every state in the region had with these emancipations being the first in the Atlantic World The Missouri Compromise admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the parallel The outcome de facto sectionalized the country into two factions free states which forbade slavery and slave states which protected the institution it was controversial widely seen as dividing the country along sectarian lines In the South the invention of the cotton gin spurred entrenchment of slavery with regional elites and intellectuals increasingly viewing the institution as a positive good instead of a necessary evil Although the federal government outlawed American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in after cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South and along with it the use of slave labor The Second Great Awakening especially in the period converted millions to evangelical Protestantism In the North it energized multiple social reform movements including abolitionism in the South Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations In the late th century American settlers began to expand further westward some of them with a sense of manifest destiny The Louisiana Purchase almost doubled the nation s area Spain ceded Florida and other Gulf Coast territory in the Republic of Texas was annexed in during a period of expansionism and the Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U S control of the present day American Northwest As it expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation The Trail of Tears in the s exemplified the Indian removal policy that forcibly resettled Indians The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River and eventually conflict with Mexico Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and their confinement to Indian reservations Victory in the Mexican American War resulted in the Mexican Cession of California and much of the present day American Southwest with the U S now spanning the continent The California Gold Rush of spurred migration to the Pacific coast which led to the California Genocide and the creation of additional western states Civil War and Reconstruction Irreconcilable sectional conflict regarding the enslavement of those of black African descent was the primary cause of the American Civil War With the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln conventions in eleven slave states all in the Southern United States declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America while the federal government the Union maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate On April the Confederacy initiated military conflict by bombarding Fort Sumter a federal garrison in Charleston harbor South Carolina The ensuing Civil War was the deadliest military conflict in American history resulting in the deaths of approximately soldiers from both sides and upwards of civilians almost all of them in the South Reconstruction began in earnest following the defeat of the Confederates While President Lincoln attempted to foster reconciliation between the Union and former Confederacy his assassination on April drove a wedge between North and South again Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans and the so called Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution guaranteed the abolishment of slavery full citizenship to Americans of African descent and suffrage for adult Black males They persisted until the Compromise of Influential Southern whites calling themselves Redeemers took local control of the South after the end of Reconstruction beginning the nadir of American race relations From to the Redeemers established so called Jim Crow laws disenfranchising almost all blacks and some impoverished whites throughout the region Blacks would face racial segregation nationwide especially in the South They also lived under constant threat of vigilante violence including lynching Development of modern America National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West After the American Civil War new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans Mainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in In pro American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii which the U S annexed in Puerto Rico Guam and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year by the Treaty of Paris following the Spanish American War Neither the Foraker Act nor the Insular Cases accorded US citizenship to Puerto Ricans One month prior to American entry into World War I citizenship was extended to Puerto Ricans via the Jones Shafroth Act In November the US acquired a perpetual lease of the Panama Canal Zone via the Hay Bunau Varilla Treaty after providing naval aid preventing Colombia from putting down the rebellion which led to the creation of an independent Panama The logistics of the November uprising were prepared in New York American Samoa was acquired by the United States in after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War The U S Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in Rapid economic development during the late th and early th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt John D Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie led the nation s progress in the railroad petroleum and steel industries Banking became a major part of the economy with J P Morgan playing a notable role The United States also emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry in the early th century In the North urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country s industrialization Electric light and the telephone drastically changed communication and urban life The American economy boomed becoming the world s largest These dramatic changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality immigration and social unrest which prompted the rise of organized labor along with populist socialist and anarchist movements This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era which saw significant reforms including health and safety regulation of consumer goods the rise of labor unions and greater antitrust measures to ensure competition among businesses and attention to worker conditions The Great Migration beginning around also brought millions of African Americans to Northern urban centers from the rural South Modern America and World Wars The last vestiges of the Progressive Era resulted in women s suffrage and alcohol prohibition The first state to grant women the right to vote was Wyoming in followed by some other states before the women s rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting nationwide women s suffrage in The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in until when it joined the war as an associated power alongside the Allies of World War I helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers In President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U S to join the League of Nations However the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations The s and s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of and the onset of the Great Depression After his election as President in

World War II the United States began supplying war materiel to the Allies in March A total of billion equivalent to billion in worth of supplies was shipped in or of the total war expenditures of the U S On December the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor prompting the United States to militarily join the Allies against the Axis powers and in the following year to intern about Japanese and Japanese Americans The U S pursued a Europe first defense policy with the Philippines being invaded and occupied by Japan until the country s liberation by the U S led forces in During the war the United States was one of the Four Policemen who met to plan the postwar world along with Britain the Soviet Union and China The United States emerged relatively unscathed from the war and with even greater economic and military influence The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe s postwar reorganization As an Allied victory was achieved in Europe a international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter which became active after the war The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August the Japanese subsequently surrendered on September ending World War II Postwar America After World War II the United States financed and implemented the Marshall Plan to help rebuild and economically revive war torn Europe disbursements paid between and would total billion billion in Also at this time geopolitical tensions between the United States and Soviet Russia led to the Cold War driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism The two countries dominated the military affairs of Europe with the U S and its NATO allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellite states on the other Unlike the US the USSR concentrated on its own recovery seizing and transferring most of Germany s industrial plants and it exacted war reparations from its Soviet Bloc satellites using Soviet dominated joint enterprises The U S sometimes opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet sponsored occasionally pursuing direct action for regime change against left wing governments American troops fought the communist forces in the Korean War of and the U S became increasingly involved in the Vietnam War introducing combat forces in Their competition to achieve superior spaceflight capability led to the Space Race which culminated in the U S becoming the first and only nation to land people on the Moon in While both countries engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear weapons they avoided direct military conflict At home the United States experienced sustained economic expansion urbanization and a rapid growth of its population and middle class following World War II Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation s transportation infrastructure in decades to come In the United States admitted Alaska and Hawaii to become the th and th states formally expanding

responded to economic stagnation with neoliberal reforms and accelerated the rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union after its invasion of Afghanistan During Reagan s presidency the federal debt held by the public nearly tripled in nominal terms from billion to trillion This led to the United States moving from the world s largest international creditor to the world s largest debtor nation The collapse of the USSR s network of satellite states in Eastern Europe in and the subsequent dissolution of the country itself in ended the Cold War with American victory ensuring a global unipolarity in which the U S was unchallenged as the world s sole superpower Fearing the spread of regional international instability from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August President George H W
