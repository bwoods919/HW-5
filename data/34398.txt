Zeus Ancient Greek is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion who rules as king of the gods on Mount Olympus His name is cognate with the first syllable of his Roman equivalent Jupiter His mythology and powers are similar though not identical to those of other Indo European deities such as Perk nas Perun Indra Dyaus and Zojz Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea the youngest of his siblings to be born though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus s stomach In most traditions he is married to Hera by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares Eileithyia Hebe and Hephaestus At the oracle of Dodona his consort was said to be Dione by whom the Iliad states that he fathered Aphrodite According to the Theogony Zeus first wife was Metis by whom he had Athena Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades These resulted in many divine and heroic offspring including Apollo Artemis Hermes Persephone Dionysus Perseus Heracles Helen of Troy Minos and the Muses He was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned roles to the others Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father and all the gods rise in his presence He was equated with many foreign weather gods permitting Pausanias to observe That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men Zeus symbols are the thunderbolt eagle bull and oak In addition to his Indo European inheritance the classical cloud gatherer Greek Nephel gereta also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient Near East such as the scepter Zeus is frequently depicted by Greek artists in one of three poses standing striding forward with a thunderbolt leveled in his raised right hand or seated in majesty It was very important for the lightning to be exclusively in the god s right hand as the Greeks believed that people who were left handed were associated with bad luck Name The god s name in the nominative is Ze s It is inflected as follows vocative Ze accusative D a genitive Di s dative Di Diogenes La rtius quotes Pherecydes of Syros as spelling the name Zeus is the Greek continuation of Di us the name of the Proto Indo European god of the daytime sky also called Dyeus ph t r Sky Father The god is known under this name in the Rigveda Vedic Sanskrit Dyaus Dyaus Pita Latin compare Jupiter from Iuppiter deriving from the Proto Indo European vocative dyeu ph t r deriving from the root dyeu to shine and in its many derivatives sky heaven god Albanian Zoj z is also a cognate of Zeus In both the Greek and Albanian forms the original cluster di underwent affrication to dz Zeus is the only deity in the Olympic pantheon whose name has such a transparent Indo European etymology The earliest attested forms of the name are the Mycenaean Greek di we and di wo written in the Linear B syllabic script Plato in his Cratylus gives a folk etymology of Zeus meaning cause of life always to all things because of puns between alternate titles of Zeus Zen and Dia with the Greek words for life and because of This etymology along with Plato s entire method of deriving etymologies is not supported by modern scholarship Diodorus Siculus wrote that Zeus was also called Zen because the humans believed that he was the cause of life zen While Lactantius wrote that he was called Zeus and Zen not because he is the giver of life but because he was the first who lived of the children of Cronus Zeus was called by numerous alternative names or surnames known as epithets Some epithets are the surviving names of local gods who were consolidated into the myth of Zeus Mythology Birth In Hesiod s Theogony c BC Cronus after castrating his father Uranus becomes the supreme ruler of the cosmos and weds his sister Rhea by whom he begets three daughters and three sons Hestia Demeter Hera Hades Poseidon and lastly wise Zeus the youngest of the six He swallows each child as soon as they are born having received a prophecy from his parents Gaia and Uranus that one of his own children is destined to one day overthrow him as he overthrew his father This causes Rhea unceasing grief and upon becoming pregnant with her sixth child Zeus she approaches her parents Gaia and Uranus seeking a plan to save her child and bring retribution to Cronus Following her parents instructions she travels to Lyctus in Crete where she gives birth to Zeus handing the newborn child over to Gaia for her to raise and Gaia takes him to a cave on Mount Aegaeon Rhea then gives to Cronus in the place of a child a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes which he promptly swallows unaware that it isn t his son While Hesiod gives Lyctus as Zeus s birthplace he is the only source to do so and other authors give different locations The poet Eumelos of Corinth th century BC according to John the Lydian considered Zeus to have been born in Lydia while the Alexandrian poet Callimachus c c BC in his Hymn to Zeus says that he was born in Arcadia Diodorus Siculus fl st century BC seems at one point to give Mount Ida as his birthplace but later states he is born in Dicte and the mythographer Apollodorus first or second century AD similarly says he was born in a cave in Dicte Infancy While the Theogony says nothing of Zeus s upbringing other than that he grew up swiftly other sources provide more detailed accounts According to Apollodorus Rhea after giving birth to Zeus in a cave in Dicte gives him to the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida daughters of Melisseus to nurse They feed him on the milk of the she goat Amalthea while the Kouretes guard the cave and beat their spears on their shields so that Cronus cannot hear the infant s crying Diodorus Siculus provides a similar account saying that after giving birth Rhea travels to Mount Ida and gives the newborn Zeus to the Kouretes who then takes him to some nymphs not named who raised him on a mixture of honey and milk from the goat Amalthea He also refers to the Kouretes rais ing a great alarum and in doing so deceiving Cronus and relates that when the Kouretes were carrying the newborn Zeus that the umbilical cord fell away at the river Triton Hyginus in his Fabulae relates a version in which Cronus casts Poseidon into the sea and Hades to the Underworld instead of swallowing them When Zeus is born Hera also not swallowed asks Rhea to give her the young Zeus and Rhea gives Cronus a stone to swallow Hera gives him to Amalthea who hangs his cradle from a tree where he isn t in heaven on earth or in the sea meaning that when Cronus later goes looking for Zeus he is unable to find him Hyginus also says that Ida Althaea and Adrasteia usually considered the children of Oceanus are sometimes called the daughters of Melisseus and the nurses of Zeus According to a fragment of Epimenides the nymphs Helike and Kynosura are the young Zeus s nurses Cronus travels to Crete to look for Zeus who to conceal his presence transforms himself into a snake and his two nurses into bears According to Musaeus after Zeus is born Rhea gives him to Themis Themis in turn gives him to Amalthea who owns a she goat which nurses the young Zeus Antoninus Liberalis in his Metamorphoses says that Rhea gives birth to Zeus in a sacred cave in Crete full of sacred bees which become the nurses of the infant While the cave is considered forbidden ground for both mortals and gods a group of thieves seek to steal honey from it Upon laying eyes on the swaddling clothes of Zeus their bronze armour split s away from their bodies and Zeus would have killed them had it not been for the intervention of the Moirai and Themis he instead transforms them into various species of birds Ascension to Power According to the Theogony after Zeus reaches manhood Cronus is made to disgorge the five children and the stone by the stratagems of Gaia but also by the skills and strength of Zeus presumably in reverse order vomiting out the stone first then each of the five children in the opposite order to swallowing Zeus then sets up the stone at Delphi so that it may act as a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men Zeus next frees the Cyclopes who in return and out of gratitude give him his thunderbolt which had previously been hidden by Gaia Then begins the Titanomachy the war between the Olympians led by Zeus and the Titans led by Cronus for control of the universe with Zeus and the Olympians fighting from Mount Olympus and the Titans fighting from Mount Othrys The battle lasts for ten years with no clear victor emerging until upon Gaia s advice Zeus releases the Hundred Handers who similarly to the Cyclopes were imprisoned beneath the Earth s surface He gives them nectar and ambrosia and revives their spirits and they agree to aid him in the war Zeus then launches his final attack on the Titans hurling bolts of lightning upon them while the Hundred Handers attack with barrages of rocks and the Titans are finally defeated with Zeus banishing them to Tartarus and assigning the Hundred Handers the task of acting as their warders Apollodorus provides a similar account saying that when Zeus reaches adulthood he enlists the help of the Oceanid Metis who gives Cronus an emetic forcing to him to disgorge the stone and Zeus s five siblings Zeus then fights a similar ten year war against the Titans until upon the prophesying of Gaia he releases the Cyclopes and Hundred Handers from Tartarus first slaying their warder Campe The Cyclopes give him his thunderbolt Poseidon his trident and Hades his helmet of invisibility and the Titans are defeated and the Hundred Handers made their guards According to the Iliad after the battle with the Titans Zeus shares the world with his brothers Poseidon and Hades by drawing lots Zeus receives the sky Poseidon the sea and Hades the underworld with the earth and Olympus remaining common ground Challenges to Power Upon assuming his place as king of the cosmos Zeus rule is quickly challenged The first of these challenges to his power comes from the Giants who fight the Olympian gods in a battle known as the Gigantomachy According to Hesiod the Giants are the offspring of Gaia born from the drops of blood that fell on the ground when Cronus castrated his father Uranus there is however no mention of a battle between the gods and the Giants in the Theogony It is Apollodorus who provides the most complete account of the Gigantomachy He says that Gaia out of anger at how Zeus had imprisoned her children the Titans bore the Giants to Uranus There comes to the gods a prophecy that the Giants cannot be defeated by the gods on their own but can be defeated only with the help of a mortal Gaia upon hearing of this seeks a special pharmakon herb that will prevent the Giants from being killed Zeus however orders Eos Dawn Selene Moon and Helios Sun to stop shining and harvests all of the herb himself before having Athena summon Heracles In the conflict Porphyrion one of the most powerful of the Giants launches an attack upon Heracles and Hera Zeus however causes Porphyrion to become lustful for Hera and when he is just about to violate her Zeus strikes him with his thunderbolt before Heracles deals the fatal blow with an arrow In the Theogony after Zeus defeats the Titans and banishes them to Tartarus his rule is challenged by the monster Typhon a giant serpentine creature who battles Zeus for control of the cosmos According to Hesiod Typhon is the offspring of Gaia and Tartarus described as having a hundred snaky fire breathing heads Hesiod says he would have come to reign over mortals and immortals had it not been for Zeus noticing the monster and dispatching with him quickly the two of them meet in a cataclysmic battle before Zeus defeats him easily with his thunderbolt and the creature is hurled down to Tartarus Epimenides presents a different version in which Typhon makes his way into Zeus s palace while he is sleeping only for Zeus to wake and kill the monster with a thunderbolt Aeschylus and Pindar give somewhat similar accounts to Hesiod in that Zeus overcomes Typhon with relative ease defeating him with his thunderbolt Apollodorus in contrast provides a more complex narrative Typhon is similarly to in Hesiod the child of Gaia and Tartarus produced out of anger at Zeus s defeat of the Giants The monster attacks heaven and all of the gods out of fear transform into animals and flee to Egypt except for Zeus who attacks the monster with his thunderbolt and sickle Typhon is wounded and retreats to Mount Kasios in Syria where Zeus grapples with him giving the monster a chance to wrap him in his coils and rip out the sinews from his hands and feet Disabled Zeus is taken by Typhon to the Corycian Cave in Cilicia where he is guarded by the she dragon Delphyne Hermes and Aegipan however steal back Zeus s sinews and refit them reviving him and allowing him to return to the battle pursuing Typhon who flees to Mount Nysa there Typhon is given ephemeral fruits by the Moirai which reduce his strength The monster then flees to Thrace where he hurls mountains at Zeus which are sent back at him by the god s thunderbolts before while fleeing to Sicily Zeus launches Mount Etna upon him finally ending him Nonnus who gives the longest and most detailed account presents a narrative similar to Apollodorus with differences such as that it is instead Cadmus and Pan who recovers Zeus s sinews by luring Typhon with music and then tricking him In the Iliad Homer tells of another attempted overthrow in which Hera Poseidon and Athena conspire to overpower Zeus and tie him in bonds It is only because of the Nereid Thetis who summons Briareus one of the Hecatoncheires to Olympus that the other Olympians abandon their plans out of fear for Briareus Seven wives According to Hesiod Zeus takes Metis one of the Oceanid daughters of Oceanus and Tethys as his first wife However when she is about to give birth to a daughter Athena he swallows her whole upon the advice of Gaia and Uranus as it had been foretold that after bearing a daughter she would give birth to a son who would overthrow him as king of gods and mortals it is from this position that Metis gives counsel to Zeus In time Athena is born emerging from Zeus s head but the foretold son never comes forth Apollodorus presents a similar version stating that Metis took many forms in attempting to avoid Zeus s embraces and that it was Gaia alone who warned Zeus of the son who would overthrow him According to a fragment likely from the Hesiodic corpus quoted by Chrysippus it is out of anger at Hera for producing Hephaestus on her own that Zeus has intercourse with Metis and then swallows her thereby giving rise to Athena from himself A scholiast on the Iliad in contrast states that when Zeus swallows her Metis is pregnant with Athena not by Zeus himself but by the Cyclops Brontes The motif of Zeus swallowing Metis can be seen as a continuation of the succession myth it is prophesied that a son of Zeus will overthrow him just as he overthrew his father but whereas Cronos met his end because he did not swallow the real Zeus Zeus holds onto his power because he successfully swallows the threat in the form of the potential mother and so the cycle of displacement is brought to an end In addition the myth can be seen as an allegory for Zeus gaining the wisdom of Metis for himself by swallowing her In Hesiod s account Zeus s second wife is Themis one of the Titan daughters of Uranus and Gaia with whom he has the Horae listed as Eunomia Dike and Eirene and the three Moirai Clotho Lachesis and Atropos A fragment from Pindar calls Themis Zeus s first wife and states that she is brought by the Moirai in this version not her daughters up to Olympus where she becomes the bride of Zeus and bears him the Horae According to Hesiod Zeus next marries the Oceanid Eurynome with whom he has the three Charites namely Aglaea Euphrosyne and Thalia Zeus s fourth wife is his sister Demeter with whom he has Persephone Zeus s next consort is the Titan Mnemosyne as described at the beginning of the Theogony Zeus lies with Mnemosyne in Piera each night for nine nights producing the nine Muses His sixth wife is the Titan Leto who bears him the twins Apollo and Artemis who according to the Homeric Hymn to Apollo are born on the island of Delos In Hesiod s account Zeus s seventh and final wife is his sister Hera Marriage to Hera While Hera is Zeus s seventh wife in Hesiod s version in other accounts she is his first and only wife In the Theogony the couple has three children Ares Hebe and Eileithyia While Hesiod states that Hera produces Hephaestus on her own after Athena is born from Zeus s head other versions including Homer have Hephaestus as a child of Zeus and Hera as well Various authors give descriptions of a youthful affair between Zeus and Hera In the Iliad the pair are described as having first lay with each other before Cronus is sent to Tartarus without the knowledge of their parents A scholiast on the Iliad states that after Cronus is banished to Tartarus Oceanus and Tethys give Hera to Zeus in marriage and only shortly after the two are wed Hera gives birth to Hephaestus having lay secretly with Zeus on the island of Samos beforehand to conceal this act she claimed that she had produced Hephaestus on her own According to another scholiast on the Iliad Callimachus in his Aetia says that Zeus lay with Hera for three hundred years on the island of Samos According to a scholion on Theocritus Idylls Zeus one day seeing Hera walking apart from the other gods becomes intent on having intercourse with her and transforms himself into a cuckoo bird landing on Mount Thornax He creates a terrible storm and when Hera arrives at the mountain and sees the bird which sits on her lap she takes pity on it laying her cloak over it Zeus then transforms back and takes hold of her when she refuses to have intercourse with him because of their mother he promises that she will become his wife Pausanias similarly refers to Zeus transforming himself into a cuckoo to woo Hera and identifies the location as Mount Thornax According to a version from Plutarch as recorded by Eusebius in his Praeparatio evangelica Hera is raised by a nymph named Macris on the island of Euboea when Zeus kidnaps her taking her to Mount Cithaeron where they find a shady hollow which serves as a natural bridal chamber When Macris comes to look for Hera Cithaeron the tutelary deity of the mountain stops her saying that Zeus is sleeping there with Leto Photius in his Bibliotheca tells us that in Ptolemy Hephaestion s New History Hera refuses to lay with Zeus and hides in a cave to avoid him before an earthborn man named Achilles convinces her to marry Zeus leading to the pair first sleeping with each other According to Stephanus of Byzantium Zeus and Hera first lay together at the city of Hermione having come there from Crete Callimachus in a fragment from his Aetia also apparently makes reference to the couple s union occurring at Naxos Though no complete account of Zeus and Hera s wedding exists various authors make reference to it According to a scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes Argonautica Pherecydes states that when Zeus and Hera are being married Gaia brings a tree which produces golden apples as a wedding gift Eratosthenes and Hyginus attribute a similar story to Pherecydes in which Hera is amazed by the gift and asks for the apples to be planted in the garden of the gods nearby to Mount Atlas Apollodorus specifies them as the golden apples of the Hesperides and says that Gaia gives them to Zeus after the marriage According to Diodorus Siculus the location of the marriage is in the land of the Knossians nearby to the river Theren while Lactantius attributes to Varro the statement that the couple are married on the island of Samos There exist several stories in which Zeus receiving advice is able to reconcile with an angered Hera According to Pausanias Hera angry with her husband retreats to the island of Euboea where she was raised and Zeus unable to resolve the situation seeks the advice of Cithaeron ruler of Plataea supposedly the most intelligent man on earth Cithaeron instructs him to fashion a wooden statue and dress it as a bride and then pretend that he is marrying one Plataea a daughter of Asopus When Hera hears of this she immediately rushes there only to discover the ruse upon ripping away the bridal clothing she is so relieved that the couple are reconciled According to a version from Plutarch as recorded by Eusebius in his Praeparatio evangelica when Hera is angry with her husband she retreats instead to Cithaeron and Zeus goes to the earth born man Alalcomeneus who suggests he pretend to marry someone else With the help of Alalcomeneus Zeus creates a wooden statue from an oak tree dresses it as a bride and names it Daidale When preparations are being made for the wedding Hera rushes down from Cithaeron followed by the women of Plataia and upon discovering the trick the couple are reconciled with the matter ending in joy and laughter among all involved Affairs After his marriage to Hera different authors describe Zeus s numerous affairs with various mortal women In many of these affairs Zeus transforms himself into an animal someone else or some other form According to a scholion on the Iliad citing Hesiod and Bacchylides when Europa is picking flowers with her female companions in a meadow in Phoenicia Zeus transforms himself into a bull lures her from the others and then carries her across the sea to the island of Crete where he resumes his usual form to sleep with her In Euripides Helen Zeus takes the form of a swan and after being chased by an eagle finds shelter in the lap of Leda subsequently seducing her while in Euripides lost play Antiope Zeus apparently took the form of a satyr to sleep with Antiope Various authors speak of Zeus raping Callisto one of the companions of Artemis doing so in the form of Artemis herself according to Ovid or as mentioned by Apollodorus in the form of Apollo and Pherecydes relates that Zeus sleeps with Alcmene the wife of Amphitryon in the form of her own husband Several accounts state that Zeus approached the Argive princess Danae in the form of a shower of gold while according to Ovid he abducts Aegina in the form of a flame In accounts of Zeus s affairs Hera is often depicted as a jealous wife with there being various stories of her persecuting either the women with whom Zeus sleeps or their children by him Several authors relate that Zeus sleeps with Io a priestess of Hera who is subsequently turned into a cow and suffers at Hera s hands according to Apollodorus Hera sends a gadfly to sting the cow driving her all the way to Egypt where she is finally transformed back into human form In later accounts of Zeus s affair with Semele a daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia Hera tricks her into persuading Zeus to grant her any promise Semele asks him to come to her as he comes to his own wife Hera and when Zeus upholds this promise she dies out of fright and is reduced to ashes According to Callimachus after Zeus sleeps with Callisto Hera turns her into a bear and instructs Artemis to shoot her In addition Zeus s son by Alcmene the hero Heracles is persecuted continuously throughout his mortal life by Hera up until his apotheosis According to Diodorus Siculus Alcmene the mother of Heracles was the very last mortal woman Zeus ever slept with following the birth of Heracles he ceased to beget humans altogether and fathered no more children List of disguises used by Zeus Offspring The following is a list of Zeus s offspring by various mothers Beside each offspring the earliest source to record the parentage is given along with the century to which the source dates Prometheus and conflicts with humans When the gods met at Mecone to discuss which portions they will receive after a sacrifice the titan Prometheus decided to trick Zeus so that humans receive the better portions He sacrificed a large ox and divided it into two piles In one pile he put all the meat and most of the fat covering it with the ox s grotesque stomach while in the other pile he dressed up the bones with fat Prometheus then invited Zeus to choose Zeus chose the pile of bones This set a precedent for sacrifices where humans will keep the fat for themselves and burn the bones for the gods Zeus enraged at Prometheus s deception prohibited the use of fire by humans Prometheus however stole fire from Olympus in a fennel stalk and gave it to humans This further enraged Zeus who punished Prometheus by binding him to a cliff where an eagle constantly ate Prometheus s liver which regenerated every night Prometheus was eventually freed from his misery by Heracles Now Zeus angry at humans decides to give humanity a punishing gift to compensate for the boon they had been given He commands Hephaestus to mold from earth the first woman a beautiful evil whose descendants would torment the human race After Hephaestus does so several other gods contribute to her creation Hermes names the woman Pandora Pandora was given in marriage to Prometheus s brother Epimetheus Zeus gave her a jar which contained many evils Pandora opened the jar and released all the evils which made mankind miserable Only hope remained inside the jar When Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he was appalled by human sacrifice and other signs of human decadence He decided to wipe out mankind and flooded the world with the help of his brother Poseidon After the flood only Deucalion and Pyrrha remained This flood narrative is a common motif in mythology In the Iliad The Iliad is an ancient Greek epic poem attributed to Homer about the Trojan war and the battle over the City of Troy in which Zeus plays a major part Scenes in which Zeus appears include Book Zeus sends Agamemnon a dream and is able to partially control his decisions because of the effects of the dream Book Zeus promises Hera to ultimately destroy the City of Troy at the end of the war Book Zeus and Poseidon ruin the Achaeans fortress Book Zeus prohibits the other Gods from fighting each other and has to return to Mount Ida where he can think over his decision that the Greeks will lose the war Book Zeus is seduced by Hera and becomes distracted while she helps out the Greeks Book Zeus wakes up and realizes that his own brother Poseidon has been aiding the Greeks while also sending Hector and Apollo to help fight the Trojans ensuring that the City of Troy will fall Book Zeus is upset that he couldn t help save Sarpedon s life because it would then contradict his previous decisions Book Zeus is emotionally hurt by the fate of Hector Book Zeus lets the other Gods lend aid to their respective sides in the war Book Zeus demands that Achilles release the corpse of Hector to be buried honourably Other myths When Hades requested to marry Zeus s daughter Persephone Zeus approved and advised Hades to abduct Persephone as her mother Demeter wouldn t allow her to marry Hades In the Orphic Rhapsodic Theogony first century BC AD Zeus wanted to marry his mother Rhea After Rhea refused to marry him Zeus turned into a snake and raped her Rhea became pregnant and gave birth to Persephone Zeus in the form of a snake would mate with his daughter Persephone which resulted in the birth of Dionysus Zeus granted Callirrhoe s prayer that her sons by Alcmaeon Acarnan and Amphoterus grow quickly so that they might be able to avenge the death of their father by the hands of Phegeus and his two sons Both Zeus and Poseidon wooed Thetis daughter of Nereus But when Themis or Prometheus prophesied that the son born of Thetis would be mightier than his father Thetis was married off to the mortal Peleus Zeus was afraid that his grandson Asclepius would teach resurrection to humans so he killed Asclepius with his thunderbolt This angered Asclepius s father Apollo who in turn killed the Cyclopes who had fashioned the thunderbolts of Zeus Angered at this Zeus would have imprisoned Apollo in Tartarus However at the request of Apollo s mother Leto Zeus instead ordered Apollo to serve as a slave to King Admetus of Pherae for a year According to Diodorus Siculus Zeus killed Asclepius because of complains from Hades who was worried that the number of people in the underworld was diminishing because of Asclepius s resurrections The winged horse Pegasus carried the thunderbolts of Zeus Zeus took pity on Ixion a man who was guilty of murdering his father in law by purifying him and bringing him to Olympus However Ixion started to lust after Hera Hera complained about this to her husband and Zeus decided to test Ixion Zeus fashioned a cloud that resembles Hera Nephele and laid the cloud Hera in Ixion s bed Ixion coupled with Nephele resulting in the birth of Centaurus Zeus punished Ixion for lusting after Hera by tying him to a wheel that spins forever Once Helios the sun god gave his chariot to his inexperienced son Phaethon to drive Phaethon could not control his father s steeds so he ended up taking the chariot too high freezing the earth or too low burning everything to the ground The earth itself prayed to Zeus and in order to prevent further disaster Zeus hurled a thunderbolt at Phaethon killing him and saving the world from further harm In a satirical work Dialogues of the Gods by Lucian Zeus berates Helios for allowing such thing to happen he returns the damaged chariot to him and warns him that if he dares do that again he will strike him with one of this thunderbolts Roles and epithets Zeus played a dominant role presiding over the Greek Olympian pantheon He fathered many of the heroes and was featured in many of their local cults Though the Homeric cloud collector was the god of the sky and thunder like his Near Eastern counterparts he was also the supreme cultural artifact in some senses he was the embodiment of Greek religious beliefs and the archetypal Greek deity Popular conceptions of Zeus differed widely from place to place Local varieties of Zeus often have little in common with each other except the name They exercised different areas of authority and were worshiped in different ways for example some local cults conceived of Zeus as a chthonic earth god rather than a god of the sky These local divinities were gradually consolidated via conquest and religious syncretism with the Homeric conception of Zeus Local or idiosyncratic versions of Zeus were given epithets surnames or titles which distinguish different conceptions of the god These epithets or titles applied to Zeus emphasized different aspects of his wide ranging authority Zeus Aegiduchos or Aegiochos Usually taken as Zeus as the bearer of the Aegis the divine shield with the head of Medusa across it although others derive it from goat and okh in reference to Zeus nurse the divine goat Amalthea Zeus Agoraeus Zeus as patron

the epithet Zygia These epithets describing them as presiding over marriage Cults of Zeus Panhellenic cults The major center where all Greeks converged to pay honor to their chief god was Olympia Their quadrennial festival featured the famous Games There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone but of ash from the accumulated remains of many centuries worth of animals sacrificed there Outside of the major inter polis sanctuaries there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world Most of the titles listed below for instance could be found at any number of Greek temples from Asia Minor to Sicily Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar for instance Zeus Velchanos With one exception Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new Will Durant observed and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features The local child of the Great Mother a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos was in time assumed as an epithet by Zeus as transpired at many other sites and he came to be venerated in Crete as Zeus Velchanos boy Zeus often simply the Kouros In Crete Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at Knossos Ida and Palaikastro In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the Hagia Triada site of a long ruined Minoan palace Broadly contemporary coins from Phaistos show the form under which he was worshiped a youth sits among the branches of a tree with a cockerel on his knees On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage Inscriptions at Gortyn and Lyttos record a Velchania festival showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete The stories of Minos and Epimenides suggest that these caves were once used for incubatory divination by kings and priests The dramatic setting of Plato s Laws is along the pilgrimage route to one such site emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge On Crete Zeus was represented in art as a long haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ho megas kouros the great youth Ivory statuettes of the Divine Boy were unearthed near the Labyrinth at Knossos by Sir Arthur Evans With the Kouretes a band of ecstatic armed dancers he presided over the rigorous military athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan paideia The myth of the death of Cretan Zeus localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source Callimachus together with the assertion of Antoninus Liberalis that a fire shone forth annually from the birth cave the infant shared with a mythic swarm of bees suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit The Hellenistic writer Euhemerus apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of Crete and that posthumously his glory had slowly turned him into a deity The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived but Christian patristic writers took up the suggestion Zeus Lykaios The epithet Zeus Lykaios wolf Zeus is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the Lykaia on the slopes of Mount Lykaion Wolf Mountain the tallest peak in rustic Arcadia Zeus had only a formal connection with the rituals and myths of this primitive rite of passage with an ancient threat of cannibalism and the possibility of a werewolf transformation for the ephebes who were the participants Near the ancient ash heap where the sacrifices took place was a forbidden precinct in which allegedly no shadows were ever cast According to Plato a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to Zeus Lykaios and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal s Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine year cycle had ended There were games associated with the Lykaia removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia Megalopolis there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios There is however the crucial detail that Lykaios or Lykeios epithets of Zeus and Apollo may derive from Proto Greek light a noun still attested in compounds such as twilight year lit light s course etc This Cook argues brings indeed much new light to the matter as Achaeus the contemporary tragedian of Sophocles spoke of Zeus Lykaios as starry eyed and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus son of Aether described by Cicero Again under this new signification may be seen Pausanias descriptions of Lykosoura being the first city that ever the sun beheld and of the altar of Zeus at the summit of Mount Lykaion before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and facing the sun rise Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as god of light Lykaios Additional cults of Zeus Although etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground Athenians and Sicilians honored Zeus Meilichios kindly or honeyed while other cities had Zeus Chthonios earthy Zeus Katachthonios under the earth and Zeus Plousios wealth bringing These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art or for emphasis as both together in one image They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits as did chthonic deities like Persephone and Demeter and also the heroes at their tombs Olympian gods by contrast usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars In some cases cities were not entirely sure whether the daimon to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in Boeotia might belong to the hero Trophonius or to Zeus Trephonius the nurturing depending on whether you believe Pausanias or Strabo The hero Amphiaraus was honored as Zeus Amphiaraus at Oropus outside of Thebes and the Spartans even had a shrine to Zeus Agamemnon Ancient Molossian kings sacrificed to Zeus Areius Strabo mention that at Tralles there was the Zeus Larisaeus In Ithome they honored the Zeus Ithomatas they had a sanctuary and a statue of Zeus and also held an annual festival in honour of Zeus which was called Ithomaea Hecatomphonia Hecatomphonia Ancient Greek meaning killing of a hundred from a hundred and to kill It was a custom of Messenians at which they offered sacrifice to Zeus when any of them had killed a hundred enemies Aristomenes have offered three times this sacrifice at the Messenian wars against Sparta Non panhellenic cults In addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men With the epithet Zeus Aetnaeus he was worshiped on Mount Aetna where there was a statue of him and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor Other examples are listed below As Zeus Aeneius or Zeus Aenesius he was worshiped in the island of Cephalonia where he had a temple on Mount Aenos Oracles of Zeus Although most oracle sites were usually dedicated to Apollo the heroes or various goddesses like Themis a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus In addition some foreign oracles such as Ba al s at Heliopolis were associated with Zeus in Greek or Jupiter in Latin The Oracle at Dodona The cult of Zeus at Dodona in Epirus where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward centered on a sacred oak When the Odyssey was composed circa BC divination was done there by barefoot priests called Selloi who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches By the time Herodotus wrote about Dodona female priestesses called peleiades doves had replaced the male priests Zeus consort at Dodona was not Hera but the goddess Dione whose name is a feminine form of Zeus Her status as a titaness suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre Hellenic deity and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle The Oracle at Siwa The oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before Alexander s day but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era Herodotus mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the Persian War Zeus Ammon was especially favored at Sparta where a temple to him existed by the time of the Peloponnesian War After Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a Libyan Sibyl Identifications with other gods Foreign gods Zeus was identified with the Roman god Jupiter and associated in the syncretic classical imagination see interpretatio graeca with various other deities such as the Egyptian Ammon and the Etruscan Tinia He along with Dionysus absorbed the role of the chief Phrygian god Sabazios in the syncretic deity known in Rome as Sabazius The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes erected a statue of Zeus Olympios in the Judean Temple in Jerusalem Hellenizing Jews referred to this statue as Baal Shamen in English Lord of Heaven Zeus is also identified with the Hindu deity Indra Not only they are the king of gods but their weapon thunder is similar Helios Zeus is occasionally conflated with the Hellenic sun god Helios who is sometimes either directly referred to as Zeus eye or clearly implied as such Hesiod for instance describes Zeus eye as effectively the sun This perception is possibly derived from earlier Proto Indo European religion in which the sun is occasionally envisioned as the eye of Dy us P at r see Hvare khshaeta Euripides in his now lost tragedy Mysians described Zeus as sun eyed and Helios is said elsewhere to be the brilliant eye of Zeus giver of life In another of Euripides tragedies Medea the chorus refers to Helios as light born from Zeus Although the connection of Helios to Zeus does not seem to have basis in early Greek cult and writings nevertheless there are many examples of direct identification in later times The Hellenistic period gave birth to Serapis a Greco Egyptian deity conceived as a chthonic avatar of Zeus whose solar nature is indicated by the sun crown and rays the Greeks depicted him with Frequent joint dedications to Zeus Serapis Helios have been found all over the Mediterranean for example the Anastasy papyrus now housed in the British Museum equates Helios to not just Zeus and Serapis but also Mithras and a series of inscriptions from Trachonitis give evidence of the cult of Zeus the Unconquered Sun There is evidence of Zeus being worshipped as a solar god in the Aegean island of Amorgos based on a lacunose inscription Zeus the Sun meaning sun elements of Zeus worship could be as early as the fifth century BC The Cretan Zeus Tallaios had solar elements to his cult Talos was the local equivalent of Helios Later representations Philosophy In Neoplatonism Zeus relation to the gods familiar from mythology is taught as the Demiurge or Divine Mind specifically within Plotinus s work the Enneads and the Platonic Theology of Proclus The Bible Zeus is mentioned in the New Testament twice first in Acts When the people living in Lystra saw the Apostle Paul heal a lame man they considered Paul and his partner Barnabas to be gods identifying Paul with Hermes and Barnabas with Zeus even trying to offer them sacrifices with the crowd Two ancient inscriptions discovered in near Lystra testify to the worship of these two gods in that city One of the inscriptions refers to the priests of Zeus and the other mentions Hermes Most Great and Zeus the sun god The second occurrence is in Acts the name of the ship in which the prisoner Paul set sail from the island of Malta bore the figurehead Sons of Zeus aka Castor and Pollux Dioscuri The deuterocanonical book of Maccabees talks of King Antiochus IV Epiphanes who in his attempt to stamp out the Jewish religion directed that the temple at Jerusalem be profaned and rededicated to Zeus Jupiter Olympius Genealogy of the Olympians Gallery See also Family tree of the Greek gods Agetor Ambulia Spartan epithet used
