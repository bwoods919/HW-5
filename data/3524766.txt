unprecedented social impact influencing popular culture internet trends and creating multimillionaire celebrities Despite its growth and success it has been widely criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of misinformation and the sharing of copyrighted content routinely violating its users privacy enabling censorship and endangering child safety and wellbeing and for its guidelines and how they are implemented History Founding and initial growth YouTube was founded by Steve Chen Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim The trio were early employees of PayPal which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign According to a story that has often been repeated in the media Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen s apartment in San Francisco Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy when Janet Jackson s breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the Indian Ocean Tsunami online which led to the idea of a video sharing site Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a reward Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans with the site s founders deciding to accept uploads of any video YouTube began as a venture capital funded technology startup Between November and April the company raised money from various investors with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two YouTube s early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo California

May the company launched a public beta and by November a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views The site launched officially on December by which time the site was receiving million views a day Clips at the time were limited to megabytes as little as seconds of footage YouTube was not the first video sharing site on the Internet Vimeo was launched in November though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor at the time and did not grow much either The week of YouTube s launch NBC Universal s Saturday Night Live ran a skit Lazy Sunday by The Lonely Island Besides helping to bolster ratings and long term viewership for Saturday Night Live Lazy Sunday s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns Despite eventually being taken down these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube s reach and led to the upload of more third party content The site grew rapidly in July the company announced that more than new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving million video views per day The choice of the name www youtube com led to problems for a similarly named website www utube com That site s owner Universal Tube Rollform Equipment filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to www utubeonline com Broadcast Yourself era On October Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for billion in Google stock The deal was

a software engineer at that time of videos accounted for of views on the site That year the company again changed its interface and at the same time introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red A subsequent interface change designed to unify the experience across desktop TV and mobile was rolled out in By that point more than hours were being uploaded every minute increasing to hours by

one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day and hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute Two years later the uploads had risen to more than hours per minute During the COVID pandemic when most of the world was under stay at home orders usage of services like YouTube significantly increased One data firm estimated that YouTube was accounting for of all internet traffic twice its pre pandemic level In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information YouTube and Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by to comply with the EU s request YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation Following a complaint alleging violations of the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA the company was fined million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under

the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement After testing earlier in YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November claiming the reason for the removal was based on its internal research that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying YouTube co founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as a stupid idea and that the real reason behind the change was not a good one and not one that will be publicly disclosed He felt that users ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential saying The process works and there s a name for it the wisdom of the crowds The process breaks when the platform interferes with it Then the platform invariably declines Shortly after the announcement software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike an open source third party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video s number of dislikes In a letter published on January by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision but reiterated that she stands by this decision claiming that it reduced dislike attacks In YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads YouTube ended the experiment on September of that year In October YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles e g MrBeast in addition to channel names which would also become channel URLs

multimedia capabilities of Web browsers supporting the HTML standard This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug in to be installed On January YouTube announced that HTML would be the default playback method on supported browsers HTML video streams use Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP MPEG DASH an HTTP based adaptive bit rate streaming solution optimizes the bitrate and quality for the available network The platform can serve videos at optionally lower resolution levels starting at p for smoothening playback in areas and countries with limited Internet speeds improving compatibility as well as for the preservation of limited cellular data plans The resolution can be adjusted automatically based on detected connection speed or set manually From to users could add annotations to their videos such as pop up text messages and hyperlinks which allowed for interactive videos By all annotations had been removed from videos breaking some videos that depended on the feature YouTube introduced standardized widgets intended to replace annotations in a cross platform manner including end screens a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video In YouTube became an International Standard Name Identifier ISNI registry and announced its intention to begin creating ISNI identifiers to uniquely identify the musicians whose videos it features Users can verify their account normally through a mobile phone to gain the ability to upload videos up to hours in length as well as produce live streams Users who have built sufficient channel history and have a good track record of complying with the site s Community Guidelines will also gain access to these aforementioned features as well When YouTube was launched in it was possible to upload longer videos but a minute limit was introduced in March after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films The minute limit was increased to minutes in July Videos can be at most GB in size or hours whichever is less As of automatic closed captions using speech recognition technology when a video is uploaded are available in languages and can be machine translated during playback YouTube also offers manual closed captioning as part of its creator studio YouTube formerly offered a Community Captions feature where viewers could write and submit captions for public display upon approval by the video uploader but this was deprecated in September YouTube accepts the most common container formats including MP Matroska FLV AVI WebM GP MPEG PS and the QuickTime File Format Some intermediate video formats i e primarily used for professional video editing not for final delivery or storage are also accepted such as ProRes YouTube provides recommended encoding settings Each video is identified by an eleven character case sensitive alphanumerical Base string in the Uniform Resource Locator URL which can contain letters digits an underscore and a dash In YouTube added a feature called Premiere which displays a notification to the user mentioning when the video will be available for the first time like for a live stream but with a prerecorded video When the scheduled time arrives the video is aired as a live broadcast with a two minute countdown Optionally a premiere can be initiated immediately Quality and formats YouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level displayed at a resolution of pixels using the

available in a range of quality levels Viewers only indirectly influence the video quality In the mobile apps users choose between Auto which adjusts resolution based on the internet connection High Picture Quality which will prioritize playing high quality video Data saver which will sacrifice video quality in favor of low data usage and Advanced which lets the user choose a stream resolution On desktop users choose between Auto and a specific resolution It is not possible for the viewer to directly choose a higher bitrate quality for any selected resolution Since viewers have had the ability to watch D videos In YouTube began natively supporting degree video Since April it allowed live streaming video and both normal and video at up to p and since November both at up to K p resolution Citing the limited number of users who watched more than degrees it began supporting an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR which it said was easier to produce which allows users to watch any video using virtual reality headsets In response to increased viewership during the COVID pandemic YouTube temporarily downgraded the quality of its videos YouTube developed its own chip called Argos to help with encoding higher resolution videos in In certain cases YouTube allows the uploader to upgrade the quality of videos uploaded a long time ago in poor quality One such partnership with Universal Music Group included remasters of music videos Live streaming YouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming including a concert by U in and a question and answer session with US President Barack Obama in February These tests had relied on technology from rd party partners but in September YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure In April YouTube announced the rollout of YouTube Live The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners It was used for real time broadcasting of events such as the Olympics in London In

support video User features Comment system Most videos enable users to leave comments which have attracted attention for the negative aspects of their form and content In Time praised Web for enabling community and collaboration on a scale never seen before and added that YouTube harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred The Guardian in described users comments on YouTube as Juvenile aggressive misspelt sexist homophobic swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance with the occasional burst of wit shining through The Daily Telegraph commented in September that YouTube was notorious for some of the most confrontational and ill formed comment exchanges on the internet and reported on YouTube Comment Snob a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts The Huffington Post noted in April that finding comments on YouTube that appear offensive stupid and crass to the vast majority of the people is hardly difficult Google subsequently implemented a comment system oriented on Google on November that required all YouTube users to use a Google account to comment on videos The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse In response YouTube co founder Jawed Karim posted the question why the fuck do I need a google account to comment on a video on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change The official YouTube announcement received thumbs down votes and generated more than comments in two days Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island Chase Melvin noted that Google is nowhere near as popular a social media network like Facebook but it s essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don t want to lose their ability to comment on videos and added that Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with the outcry against the new comment system In the same article Melvin goes on to say Perhaps user complaints are justified but the idea of revamping the old system isn t so bad Think of the crude misogynistic and racially charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation Isn t any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot The system is far from perfect but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity Later on July Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google account to post comments to YouTube On November YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam They can also allow other users to moderate their comments In December it was reported that YouTube would launch a new feature that will warn users who post a comment that may be offensive to others Community On September YouTube launched a public beta of Community a social media based feature that allows users to post text images including GIFs live videos and others in a separate Community tab on their channel Prior to the release several creators had been consulted to suggest tools Community could incorporate that they would find useful these YouTubers included Vlogbrothers AsapScience Lilly Singh The Game Theorists Karmin The Key of Awesome The Kloons Peter Hollens Rosianna Halse Rojas Sam Tsui Threadbanger and Vsauce After the feature has been officially released the community post feature gets activated automatically for every channel that passes a specific threshold of subscriber counts or already has more subscribers This threshold was lowered over time from subscribers to subscribers to subscribers to subscribers Channels that the community tab becomes enabled for get their channel discussions previously known as channel comments permanently erased instead of co existing or migrating TestTube Experimental features of YouTube can be accessed in an area of the site named TestTube For example in October a comment search feature accessible under comment search was implemented as part of this program The feature was removed later Later the same year YouTube Feather was introduced as a lightweight alternative website for countries with limited internet speeds Content accessibility YouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs Users wishing to post a video discussing inspired by or related to another user s video can make a video response The eleven character YouTube video identifier possible characters used in each position allows for a theoretical maximum of or around quintillion billion billion unique ids YouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature on August Embedding rating commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface A small number of videos can be downloaded as MP files Numerous third party web sites applications and browser plug ins allow users to download YouTube videos In February YouTube announced a test service allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout In June Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos In response Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site Users retain copyright of their own work under the default Standard YouTube License but have the option to grant certain usage rights under any public copyright license they choose Since July it has been possible to select a Creative Commons attribution license as the default allowing other users to reuse and remix the material Platforms Most modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos either within an application or through an optimized website YouTube Mobile was launched in June using RTSP streaming for the video Not all of YouTube s videos are available on the mobile version of the site Since June YouTube s videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products This required YouTube s content to be transcoded into Apple s preferred video standard H a process that took several months YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV iPod Touch and the iPhone The mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML in July avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform In September YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone and iOS operating system According to GlobalWebIndex YouTube was used by of smartphone users between April and June making it the third most used app A TiVo service update in July allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos In January YouTube launched YouTube for TV a version of the website tailored for set top boxes and other TV based media devices with web browsers initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the

YouTube launched as a downloadable app for the Nintendo Switch in November International and localization On June Google CEO Eric Schmidt appeared in Paris to launch the new localization system The interface of the website is available with localized versions in countries one territory Hong Kong and a worldwide version The YouTube interface suggests which local version should be chosen based on the IP address of the user In some cases the message This video is not available in your country may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content The interface of the YouTube website is available in language versions including Amharic Albanian Armenian Burmese Kyrgyz Mongolian Persian and Uzbek which do not have local channel versions Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between and following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atat rk and some material offensive to Muslims In October a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey with the domain youtube com tr The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law In March a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty collection agency PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach an agreement on a licensing deal The dispute was resolved in September In April a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany Videos In January it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of minutes a day on the site in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television In viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day In December two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube prompting a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site s terms of service which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts This was disputed by Billboard which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo since the videos were no longer active on YouTube On August YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video s view count to freeze at later until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud YouTube view counts once again updated in real time Since September subscriber counts are abbreviated Only three leading digits of channels subscriber counts are indicated publicly compromising the function of third party real time indicators such as that of Social Blade Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio On November after testing out this change in March of the same year YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos making them invisible to viewers The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool according to YouTube Copyright issues YouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright including the site s first viral video Lazy Sunday which had to be taken down due to copyright concerns At the time of uploading a video YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws Despite this advice many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted From to organizations including Viacom Mediaset and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material In August a US court ruled in Lenz v Universal Music Corp that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material YouTube s owner Google announced in November that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply In the case of Smith v Summit Entertainment LLC professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube He asserted seven causes of action and four were ruled in Smith s favor In April a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users On November the dispute with GEMA was resolved with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA In April it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter notice As part of YouTube Music Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in which was followed by separate agreements other major labels which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube By creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use Content ID In June YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute The system which was initially called Video Identification and later became known as Content ID creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material and stores it in a database When a video is uploaded it is checked against the database and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found When this occurs the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable tracking the viewing statistics of the video or adding advertisements to the video An independent test in uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was surprisingly resilient in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos it was not infallible The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision Before videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved Since April videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress and the money goes to whoever won the dispute Should the uploader want to monetize the video again they may remove the disputed audio in the Video Manager YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site s rules were modified in December to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length Moderation and offensive content YouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site s features The uploading of videos containing defamation pornography and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube s Community Guidelines Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content videos of animal abuse shock videos content uploaded without the copyright holder s consent hate speech spam and predatory behavior YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site s guidelines Despite the guidelines YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising YouTube contracts companies to hire content moderators who view content flagged as potentially violating YouTube s content policies and determines if they should be removed In September a class action suit was filed by a former content moderator who reported developing post traumatic stress disorder PTSD after an month period on the job The former content moderator said that she was regularly made to exceed YouTube s stated limit of four hours per day of viewing graphic content The lawsuit alleges that YouTube s contractors gave little to no training or support for its moderators mental health made prospective employees sign NDAs before showing them any examples of content they would see while reviewing and censored all mention of trauma from its internal forums It also purports that requests for extremely graphic content to be blurred reduced in size or made monochrome per recommendations from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children were rejected by YouTube as not a high priority for the company To limit the spread of misinformation and fake news via YouTube it has rolled out a comprehensive policy regarding how it plans to deal with technically manipulated videos Controversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster in which football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in In July the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was unimpressed with YouTube s system for policing its videos and argued that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user generated content YouTube responded by stating We have strict rules on what s allowed and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our review team and have it dealt with promptly We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users Given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly July In October U S Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al Awlaki YouTube pulled some of the videos in November stating they violated the site s guidelines In December YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content In YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news filling the infobox with content from Encyclop dia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech In the wake of the Notre Dame fire on April several user uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube system automatically with an Encyclop dia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September attacks Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection YouTube officials apologized for this stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically and were taking steps to remedy this On April YouTube revealed its changes in handling content associated with eating disorders This social media platform s Community Guidelines now prohibit content that could encourage emulation from at risk users This content includes behavior that shows severe calorie tracking and purging after eating However videos featuring positive behavior such as in the context of recovery will be permitted on the platform under two conditions the user must have a registered logged in account and must be older than This policy was created in collaboration with nonprofit organizations as well as the National Eating Disorder Association Garth Graham YouTube s Global Head of Healthcare revealed in an interview with CNN that this policy change was geared at ensuring that this video sharing platform provides an avenue for community recovery and resources while ensuring continued viewer protection Homophobia and transphobia Five leading content creators whose channels were based on LGBTQ materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August alleging that YouTube s algorithms divert discovery away from their channels impacting their revenue The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like lesbian or gay which would be predominant in their channels content and because of YouTube s near monopolization of online video services they are abusing that position In June Media Matters a media watchdog group reported that homophobic and transphobic content calling LGBT people predators and groomers was becoming more common on YouTube The report also referred to common accusations in YouTube videos that LGBT people are mentally ill The report stated the content appeared to be in violation of YouTube s hate speech policy Animal torture YouTube said animal abuse has no place on their platforms and they are working to remove content YouTube as a tool to promote conspiracy theories and far right content YouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal YouTube s recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories partisan viewpoints and misleading videos even when those users haven t shown interest in such content When users show a political bias in what they choose to view YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases often with more extreme viewpoints When users search for political or scientific terms YouTube s search algorithms often give prominence to hoaxes and conspiracy theories After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking news queries during the Las Vegas shooting YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources In it was reported that YouTube was again promoting fringe content about breaking news giving great prominence to conspiracy videos about Anthony Bourdain s death In it was revealed that advertisements were being placed on extremist videos including videos by rape apologists anti Semites and hate preachers who received ad payouts After firms started to stop advertising on YouTube in the wake of this reporting YouTube apologized and said that it would give firms greater control over where ads got placed Alex Jones known for right wing conspiracy theories had built a massive audience on YouTube YouTube drew criticism in when it removed a video from Media Matters compiling offensive statements made by Jones stating that it violated its policies on harassment and bullying On August however YouTube removed Alex Jones YouTube page following a content violation University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as The Great Radicalizer saying YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the st century Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a conspiracy ecosystem In January YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy starting in the United States intended to stop recommending videos containing content that could misinform users in harmful ways YouTube gave flat earth theories miracle cures and trutherism as examples Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement In late the site began implementing measures directed towards raising authoritative content and reducing borderline content and harmful misinformation Multiple research studies have investigated cases of misinformation in YouTube In a July study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to climate and climate change the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change A BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube s algorithm promoted health misinformation including fake cancer cures In Brazil YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters as well as elevated far right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories In the Philippines numerous channels disseminated misinformation related to the Philippine elections Additionally research on the dissemination of Flat Earth beliefs in social media has shown that networks of YouTube channels form an echo chamber that polarizes audiences by appearing to confirm preexisting beliefs Use among white supremacists Before YouTube took steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site wide policies against hate speech In the wake of the March Christchurch mosque attacks YouTube and other sites like Facebook and Twitter that allowed user submitted content drew criticism for doing little to moderate and control the spread of hate speech which was considered to be a factor in the rationale for the attacks These platforms were pressured to remove such content but in an interview with The New York Times YouTube s chief product officer Neal Mohan said that unlike content such as ISIS videos which take a particular format and thus easy to detect through computer aided algorithms general hate speech was more difficult to recognize and handle and thus could not readily take action to remove without human interaction YouTube joined an initiative led by France and New Zealand with other countries and tech companies in May to develop tools to be used to block online hate speech and to develop regulations to be implemented at the national level to be levied against technology firms that failed to take steps to remove such speech though the United States declined to participate Subsequently on June YouTube announced a major change to its terms of service specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age gender race caste religion sexual orientation or veteran status YouTube identified specific examples of such videos as those that promote or glorify Nazi ideology which is inherently discriminatory YouTube further stated it would remove content denying that well documented violent events like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary took place In October YouTube banned the main channel of Red Ice a white supremacist multimedia company for hate speech violations The channel had about subscribers Lana Lokteff and Red Ice promoted a backup channel in an attempt to circumvent the ban A week later the backup channel was also removed by YouTube In June YouTube banned several channels associated with white supremacy including those of Stefan Molyneux David Duke and Richard B Spencer asserting these channels violated their policies on hate speech The ban occurred the same day that Reddit announced the ban on several hate speech sub forums including r The Donald Handling of COVID pandemic and other misinformation Following the dissemination via YouTube of misinformation related to the COVID pandemic that G communications technology was responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease which led to multiple G towers in the United Kingdom being attacked by arsonists YouTube removed all such videos linking G and the coronavirus in this manner YouTube extended this policy in September to cover videos disseminating misinformation related to any vaccine including those long approved against measles or Hepatitis B that had received approval from local health authorities or the World Health Organization The platform removed the accounts of anti vaccine campaigners such as Robert F Kennedy Jr and Joseph Mercola at this time Two accounts linked to RT Deutsch the German channel of the Russian RT network were removed as well for breaching YouTube s policies YouTube had extended this moderation to non medical areas In the weeks following the United States presidential election the site added policies to remove or label videos promoting disproving election fraud claims however it reversed this policy in June citing that the removal was necessary to openly debate political ideas even those that are controversial or based on disproven assumptions Google and YouTube implemented policies in October to deny monetization or revenue to advertisers or content creators that promoted climate change denial which includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam claims denying that long term trends show the global climate is warming and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change In July YouTube announced policies to combat misinformation surrounding abortion such as videos with instructions to perform abortion methods that are considered unsafe and videos that contain misinformation about the safety of abortion Child safety and wellbeing Leading into there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family s activities and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family friendly material In YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by However with the increase in videos featuring children the site began to face several controversies related to child safety During Q the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive which featured themselves playing pranks on their children were accused of child abuse Their videos were eventually deleted and two of their children were removed from their custody A similar case happened in when the owners of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children Her videos would later be deleted Later that year YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent sexual or otherwise disturbing situations many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views The term Elsagate was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy On November YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content Later that month the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family friendly characters As part of a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube the wave of deletions also targeted channels that showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults Most notably the company removed Toy Freaks a channel with over million subscribers that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations According to analytics specialist SocialBlade it earned up to million annually prior to its deletion Even for content that appears to be aimed at children and appears to contain only child friendly content YouTube s system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos These questions have been raised in the past as YouTube has had to remove channels with children s content which after becoming popular then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children s content Alternative some of the most watched children s programming on YouTube comes from channels that have no identifiable owners raising concerns of intent and purpose One channel that had been of concern was Cocomelon which provided numerous mass produced animated videos aimed at children Up through it had drawn up to US million a month in ad revenue and was one of the largest kid friendly channels on YouTube before Ownership of Cocomelon was unclear outside of its ties to Treasure Studio itself an unknown entity raising questions as to the channel s purpose but Bloomberg News had been able to confirm and interview the small team of American owners in February regarding Cocomelon who stated their goal for the channel was to simply entertain children wanting to keep to themselves to avoid attention from outside investors The anonymity of such channel raise concerns because of the lack of knowledge of what purpose they are trying to serve The difficulty to identify who operates these channels adds to the lack of accountability according to Josh Golin of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood and educational consultant Ren e Chernow O Leary found the videos were designed to entertain with no intent to educate all leading to critics and parents to be concerned for their children becoming too enraptured by the content from these channels Content creators that earnestly make child friendly videos have found it difficult to compete with larger channels unable to produce content at the same rate as them and lacking the same means of being promoted through YouTube s recommendation algorithms that the larger animated channel networks have shared In January YouTube officially banned videos containing challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm such as the Tide Pod Challenge and videos featuring pranks that make victims believe they re in physical danger or cause emotional distress in children Sexualization of children and pedophilia Also in November it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children often uploaded by the minors themselves and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics were attracting comments from pedophiles with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian Other child centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles As a result of the controversy which added to the concern about Elsagate several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube In December The Times found more than grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior such as taking off clothes adopting overtly sexual poses and touching other children inappropriately by strangers After a reporter flagged the videos in question half of them were removed and the rest were removed after The Times contacted YouTube s PR department In February YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a wormhole that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content and make all of that user s recommended content feature only these types of videos Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions or otherwise making indecent remarks In some cases other users had re uploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos and then monetized these propagating this network In the wake of the controversy the service reported that they had deleted over channels and tens of millions of comments and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children A spokesperson explained that any content including comments that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube There s more to be done and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly Despite these measures AT T Disney Dr Oetker Epic Games and Nestl all pulled their advertising from YouTube Subsequently YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children and preemptively disable their comments sections Trusted partners can request that comments be re enabled but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments These actions mainly target videos of toddlers but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual such as gymnastics YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators A related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string CP an abbreviation of child pornography resulted in some prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation including videos related to the mobile video game Pok mon Go which uses CP as an abbreviation of the statistic Combat Power and Club Penguin YouTube apologized for the errors and reinstated the affected videos Separately online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T Series rivalry in early YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity In June The New York Times cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children As a result Senator Josh Hawley stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as recommended videos excluding those that were professionally produced such as videos of televised talent shows YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system Misogyny A January report by the social media analytics firm Bot Sentinel said that several online influencers were using YouTube to exclusively post negative content about Prince Harry and Meghan including conspiracy theories about the couple in what it called a lucrative hate for profit enterprise where racism and YouTube ad revenue are the primary motivators Bot Sentinel also found that one of the most prominent accounts promoting a conspiracy theory that Meghan was never pregnant had accumulated nearly million views and was earning around a year YouTube banned the account in March An August report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate a British think tank found that harassment against women was flourishing on YouTube It noted that channels

Private individuals and large production corporations have used YouTube to grow their audiences Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic Concurrently old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television While YouTube s revenue sharing Partner Program made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer its top five hundred partners each earning more than annually and its ten highest earning channels grossing from million to million in CMU business editor

videos convey has been fine tuned by millions of years of evolution TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that what Gutenberg did for writing online video can now do for face to face communication Anderson asserted that it is not far fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance and that video contributors may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history In education for example the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan s cousin into what Forbes Michael Noer called the largest school in the world with technology poised to disrupt how people learn YouTube was awarded a George Foster Peabody Award the website being described as a Speakers Corner that both embodies and promotes democracy The Washington Post reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube s most subscribed channels feature minorities contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white A Pew Research Center study reported the development of visual journalism in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government such as in the CNN YouTube presidential debates in which ordinary people submitted questions to U S presidential candidates via YouTube video with a techPresident co founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape Describing the Arab Spring sociologist Philip N Howard quoted an activist s succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using Facebook to schedule the protests Twitter to coordinate and YouTube to tell the world In more than a third of the U S Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony days after the Kony video was posted to YouTube with resolution co sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video will do more to lead to Kony s demise than all other action combined Conversely YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with

music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act Obamacare compliant health insurance In February U S President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the YouTube Generation Whereas YouTube s inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted the YouTube content creators new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website s distracting content and fickle audience Some YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events such as Innocence of Muslims which spurred protests and related anti American violence internationally TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos thus challenging others to improve their own skills and spurring invention and evolution in that field Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in The New York Times that such videos have surprising implications for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music A article in The New York Times Magazine posited that YouTube had become the new talk radio for the far right Almost a year before YouTube s January announcement that it would begin a gradual change of reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways Zeynep Tufekci had written in The New York Times that g iven its billion or so users YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the st century Under YouTube s changes to its recommendation engine the most recommended channel evolved from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to Fox News According to a study An emerging journalistic consensus theorizes the central role played by the video recommendation engine but we believe that this is premature Instead we propose the Supply and Demand framework for analyzing politics on YouTube A study found that despite widespread concerns that YouTube s algorithms send people down rabbit holes with recommendations to extremist videos little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture exposure to alternative and extremist channel videos on YouTube is heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment and contrary to the rabbit holes narrative non subscribers are rarely recommended videos from alternative and extremist channels and seldom follow such recommendations when offered The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra selected their membership based on individual video performances Further the cybercollaboration charity video We Are the World for Haiti YouTube edition was formed by mixing performances of globally distributed singers into a single musical work with The Tokyo Times noting the We Pray for You YouTube cyber collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes The anti bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U S President Barack Obama Vice

billion In it nearly doubled and estimated to hit billion according to eMarketer while others estimated billion The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising In May YouTube introduced a trial scheme of subscription channels with prices ranging from to a month The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix Amazon Prime and Hulu Google first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February as part of Alphabet s financial report According to Google YouTube had made US billion in ad revenue in in contrast to US billion in and US billion in YouTube s revenues made up nearly of the total Alphabet revenue in These revenues accounted for approximately million subscribers combined

advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content Google stated that it had begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear In early April the YouTube channel h h Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video On April YouTube announced that to ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review and have at least lifetime views before they may join the Partner Program YouTuber earnings In May YouTube launched its Partner Program YPP a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site YouTube typically takes percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program with percent going to the uploader There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program According to TubeMogul in a pre roll advertisement on YouTube one that is shown before the video starts cost advertisers on average per views Usually no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre roll advertisement due to a lack of interested advertisers YouTube s policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising including videos containing violence strong language sexual content controversial or sensitive subjects and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and tragedies even if graphic imagery is not shown unless the content is usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator s intent is to inform or entertain and videos whose user comments contain inappropriate content In YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos In April YouTube set an eligibility requirement of lifetime views for a paid subscription On January the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to hours of watch time within the past months and subscribers The move was seen as an attempt

what may be incorporated into videos being monetized this includes strong violence language sexual content and controversial or sensitive subjects and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and tragedies even if graphic imagery is not shown unless the content is usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator s intent is to inform or entertain In September after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations YouTube s policies were criticized by prominent users including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was censorship by a different name A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new the service had improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators Boing Boing reported in that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization As of November in the United States and June worldwide YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program This will occur on channels whose content is
