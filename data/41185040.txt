Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network s nighttime programming block Adult Swim The series follows the misadventures of Rick Sanchez a cynical mad scientist and his good hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures that take place across an infinite number of realities often traveling to other planets and dimensions through portals and on Rick s flying saucer The general concept of Rick and Morty relies on two conflicting scenarios domestic family drama and a misanthropic grandfather dragging his grandson into hijinks Roiland voiced the eponymous characters with Chris Parnell Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing the rest of Rick and Morty s family The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future created by Roiland for Channel a short film festival cofounded by Harmon Since its debut the series has received critical acclaim for its originality creativity and humor It has been nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program and won the award in and The series has also received two Annie Awards At times the series has been the most viewed television comedy for adults between and The popularity of Rick and Morty has made it a hundred million dollar merchandising and media franchise The sixth season premiered on September and consists of ten episodes A seventh season was confirmed as part of a long term deal with Cartoon Network that ordered new episodes which renewed the series through to a tenth season Adult Swim cut ties with Roiland in amid allegations of domestic abuse and announced it would be recasting his roles Premise and main characters The show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith household which consists of parents Jerry and Beth their children Summer and Morty and Beth s father Rick Sanchez who lives with them as a guest According to Justin Roiland the family lives outside of Seattle Washington The adventures of Rick and Morty however take place across an infinite number of realities with the characters traveling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick s flying saucer Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic mad scientist who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school marriage love and family He frequently goes on adventures with his year old grandson Morty a kind hearted but easily distressed boy whose na ve but grounded moral compass plays counterpoint to Rick s Machiavellian ego Morty s year old sister Summer is a more conventional teenager who worries about improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their adventures The kids mother Beth is a generally level headed person and assertive force in the household though self conscious about her professional role as a horse surgeon She is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry a simple minded and insecure person who disapproves of Rick s influence over his family Different versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the show s multiverse and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another The show s original Rick identifies himself as Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C in reference to his original universe but this does not apply to any other member of the Smith household For instance in the first season episode Rick Potion after turning the entire world population into monsters Rick and Morty move to a different dimension leaving the original Summer Beth and Jerry behind Production Development Rick and Morty was created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon The duo first met at Channel a non profit monthly short film festival in Los Angeles co founded by Harmon At Channel participants submit a short film in the format of a pilot and a live audience decides which pilots continue as a series Roiland then a producer on reality programming began submitting content to the festival a year after its launch in His pilots typically consisted of shock value sick and twisted elements that received a confused reaction from the audience Nevertheless Harmon took a liking to his humor and the two began collaborating In Roiland was fired from working on a television series he regarded as creatively stifling and funneled his creative energies into creating a webisode for Channel The result was The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti an animated short starring parodies of Doc Brown and Marty McFly characters from the Back to the Future film trilogy In the short which Harmon would dub a bastardization a pornographic vandalization Doc Smith urges Mharti to perform oral sex on him in order to go back in time The audience reacted to it wildly and Roiland began creating more shorts involving the characters which soon evolved beyond his original intentions and their obvious origin within the film from which it was culled Harmon would later create and produce Community an NBC sitcom while Roiland would work primarily in voice acting for Disney s Fish Hooks and Cartoon Network s Adventure Time In Harmon was briefly fired from Community Adult Swim searching for a more prime time hit show shortly afterward approached Harmon who initially viewed the channel as unfit for his style He was also unfamiliar with animation and his process for creating television focused more heavily on dialogue characters and story Instead he phoned Roiland to inquire if he had any ideas for an animated series Roiland immediately brought up the idea of using the Doc and Mharti characters renamed Rick and Morty At first Roiland wanted the show s run time to consist of one eleven minute segment but Adult Swim pushed for a half hour program Harmon felt the best way to extend the voices into a program would be to build a family around the characters while Adult Swim development executive Nick Weidenfeld suggested that Rick be Morty s grandfather Having pitched multiple television programs that did not get off the ground Roiland was initially very unreceptive to others attempting to give notes on his pitch Prior to developing Rick and Morty he had created three failed animated pilots for Fox and he had begun to feel burned out with developing television The first draft was completed in six hours on the Paramount Pictures lot in Dan Harmon s unfurnished Community office The duo had worked out the basics of the story that day sold the pilot and then sat down to write Roiland while acknowledging a tendency for procrastination encouraged Harmon to stay and write the entire first draft We were sitting on the floor cross legged with laptops and I was about to get up and go home and he said Wait if you go home it might take us three months to write this thing Stay here right now and we can write it in six hours He just had a premonition about that recalled Harmon In the beginning Adult Swim was unsure of Roiland doing both voices partially due to the undeveloped nature of the character of Morty Harmon wrote four short premises in which Morty took a more assertive role and sent it to Mike Lazzo Adult Swim placed a tamer TV rating on the program which was met with reluctance from the show s staff The network s reason behind the rating was that it would soon begin broadcasting in prime time competing with major programs The theme song for Rick and Morty by Ryan Elder was originally used in a rejected Cartoon Network pilot Roiland made called Dog World which was referenced in the episode Lawnmower Dog Writing Harmon has noted that the writers room at the show s studio bears a striking resemblance to the one used for Community In comparing the two he noted that the writing staff of Rick and Morty was significantly smaller and more rough and tumble verbally The first season writing staff consisted of Roiland Harmon Tom Kauffman Ryan Ridley Wade Randolph and Eric Acosta while writer s assistant Mike McMahan was also given writing credit Described as a very very tiny little writers room with a lot of heavy lifting from everybody the show s writing staff like many Adult Swim productions is not unionized with the Writers Guild of America though in production staff at Rick Morty filed a petition for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board in a bid to join The Animation Guild The writing staff first meets and discusses ideas which evolve into a story Discussions often include anecdotes from personal life as well as thoughts on the science fiction genre After breaking the story which consists of developing its consistency and logical beginning middle and conclusion a writer is assigned to create an outline Roiland and Harmon do a pass on the outline and from there the episode undergoes several more drafts The final draft of the script is last approved by either of the co creators Harmon has admitted that his perfectionism can sometimes be disruptive and cause writing schedule delays For the most part this was the reason why the third season of the show consisted of only episodes instead of as was initially intended Many episodes are structured with use of a story circle a Harmon creation based largely on Joseph Campbell s monomyth or The Hero s Journey Its two act structure places the act break at an odd location in the stages of the monomyth after The Meeting with the Goddess instead of Atonement with the Father Roiland has stated his and Harmon s intentions for the series to lack traditional continuity opting for discontinuous storylines not bound by rules He has also confirmed that the writers avoid revisiting old tropes from the show s past in fear of that coming off as disingenuous fan service In producing the series first season episodes were occasionally written out of order For example Rick Potion was the second episode written for the series but was instructed to be animated as the fifth as it would make more sense within the series continuity Animation and voice recording Animation for the show is done using Toon Boom Harmony a vector based D puppet software which is a more economical option than traditional hand drawn animation The post production work is done in Adobe After Effects and background art is done in Adobe Photoshop Production of animation is handled by Bardel Entertainment in Vancouver Canada Roiland s cartooning style is heavily indebted to The Simpsons a factor he acknowledged in a interview while also comparing his style to that of Pendleton Ward Adventure Time and J G Quintel Regular Show You ll notice mouths are kind of similar and teeth are similar but I think that s also a stylistic thing that all of us are kind of the same age and we re all inspired by The Simpsons and all these other shows we re kind of subconsciously tapping into John Kricfalusi s The Ren Stimpy Show was another strong influence for Rick and Morty which is why according to Roiland the small w shaped mouths that the characters occasionally make is a reference to a similar expression that Ren frequently makes Talking about the style guide the animators of the show have to follow season three art director Jeffrey Thompson explained that the characters are often drawn with odd or asymmetrical features in order to avoid looking too normal to live in the Rick and Morty universe When recording dialogue Roiland does a considerable amount of improvisation in order to make the characters feel more natural Roiland s firing In January it was reported that Roiland was charged with felony domestic battery and false imprisonment in Orange County California in connection with an alleged incident in January toward an unnamed woman he was reportedly dating at the time A hearing was scheduled for April Following the public revelation of the indictment allegations against Roiland s personal conduct regarding his behavior to minors on social media were made The same month Adult Swim announced that they had cut ties with Roiland and fired him from the show stating that the seventh season s production would continue and that his roles would be recast In March the Orange County District Attorney s office dropped all criminal charges against Roiland due to insufficient evidence Broadcast and ratings Rick and Morty is distributed internationally by Warner Bros Television Episodes In May Adult Swim unveiled its development slate that included a Rick and Morty pilot from Harmon and Roiland which was eventually picked up to series in October as one

four months later continuing in the same time slot from season two and the initial airing concluded in October Although it was originally intended for the season to consist of fourteen episodes as a result of production delays it eventually comprised only ten Following the conclusion of the show s third season co creators Harmon and Roiland wanted to have assurance that there would be many more

fourth season to consist of more than ten episodes In May after prolonged contract negotiations Adult Swim announced a long term deal with the creators ordering new episodes over an unspecified number of seasons Roiland was confident that this big renewal deal would allow the creators to minimize the gaps between seasons to no more than a year as they would be able to schedule their time around the

relatively strong with its premiere reaching million viewers the show s average is million However interest soon appeared to taper off after the network decided to split the season in half causing a steep drop in the season s second half about a drop in viewership from the third season The fourth episode of the fourth season saw million viewers which was noted to not be impressive in its own

available to purchase on various digital platforms including iTunes and Amazon with the digital releases of each season containing bonus material Themes and analysis Comedic style The general formula of Rick and Morty consists of the juxtaposition of two conflicting scenarios an extremely selfish alcoholic grandfather dragging his grandson along for interdimensional adventures intercut with domestic family drama Co creator Dan Harmon has described the series as a cross between Matt Groening s two shows The Simpsons and Futurama balancing family life with heavy science fiction Comparisons have been drawn to House of Cosbys a show created by Justin Roiland for having similar bits such as characters announcing themselves Mr Meeseeks Curiosity Cosby The series is inspired by British style storytelling as opposed to traditional American family TV stories Harmon has stated that his inspiration behind much of the concept and humor for the series comes from various British television series such as The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and Doctor Who He figures that the audience will only understand developments from Morty s point of view but stated we don t want to be the companions We want to hang out with the Doctor we idolize the Doctor but we don t think like him and that s really interesting Occasionally characters will acknowledge an episode s narrative or hint at the presence of a fourth wall suggesting that they are aware of the fact that they are characters of a TV show Thereunder Troy Patterson of The New Yorker notes that Rick and Morty supplies an artful answer to the question of what follows postmodernism a decadent regurgitation of all its tropes all at once leavened by some humanistic wistfulness Sean Sebastian of Junkee says that the show can be both hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time as it excels at the intersection between big ideas flippancy and wit Philosophy The series addresses the insignificance of human existence as compared to the size of the universe with no recognizable divine presence as described by Lovecraft s philosophy of cosmicism The characters of the show deal with cosmic horror and existential dread either by asserting the utility of science over magic or by choosing a life in ignorant bliss However as Joachim Heijndermans of Geeks notes none of them appear able to handle the absurd and chaotic nature of the universe as Jerry gets by through denial and Rick is a depressed substance addicted suicidal mess Harmon describes Rick as a self interested anarchist who does not like being told what to do He believes that the character s life on a larger scale has caused him mental illness and opines that the knowledge that nothing matters while accurate gets you nowhere Mental illness is a theme that is drawn on several times throughout the show one scene in particular has Rick s therapist deliver a fiery explanation of his fundamental immaturity Matthew Bulger of The Humanist notes that the creators of the series are trying to communicate the message that we need to focus on human relationships and not preoccupy our minds with unanswerable questions in order to find a sense of purpose and live a better life Eric Armstrong of The New Republic notes that Morty represents the audience as he is mostly there to react to Rick s deranged schemes The character is transformed by the truths he discovers during his interdimensional adventures with his grandfather However instead of sinking into depression Morty accepts these truths that empower him to value his own life Reception Critical reception Rick and Morty holds an average approval rating of on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes for the entire series David Weigand of San Francisco Chronicle described it as offbeat and occasionally coarse the take away here is that it works He praised the animation direction by James McDermott for being fresh colorful and as wacky as the script and states that the series possesses shades of Futurama South Park and even Beetlejuice ultimately opining that its humor felt entirely original Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times praised the series and stated that it was Grandparenting at its unhinged finest In a review shortly after the second season premiere Sean Sebastian of Junkee said that although the crude animation and over the top voice acting might have discouraged some viewers to continue watching Rick and Morty is exceptionally well made and that the more you dissect it the more you find it has to say Todd Spangler of Variety gave the series a lukewarm review saying that though it often seems frenetic at the expense of being witty it represents a welcome attempt to dream just a little bigger David Sims of The A V Club gave the series an A In reviewing the first two episodes he praised its clean simple style of animation and said the series has a dark sick sensibility He praised its effort to give each character a little bit of depth and applauded Roiland s voice talent Industry impact Several former Rick and Morty storyboard artists and crew members proceeded to develop their own shows or work on major new productions
