available as an outfit named Mecha Morty Morty Smith appears in the Half in the Bag episode Jayus Ex Mikeina from Red Letter Media with Roiland reprising his role dubbing over Jay Bauman who physically portrays Morty in the episode Reception The character has received an overall positive reception VerbStomp described Morty as Perhaps the picture of childhood innocence or perhaps the product of parental neglect Morty is unintelligent skittish and distressed likely due to his traumatic experiences while venturing into new worlds with Rick The theme song of President Morty For the Damaged Coda by indie rock band Blonde Redhead gained renewed exposure for its use in the series spawning several memes around the character and song Vulture praised the blissed out sexy indie theme music of the alternate reality President Morty and their initially adorable and non threatening appearance in The Ricklantis Mixup in addition to expressing interest in the various fan theories around the character Screen Rant praised the character as one of the most compelling villains the series could offer despite their brief and cryptic appearances in particular complimenting their Machiavellian character traits while Flickering Myth praised the character as a big fan favourite and easily the show s most enigmatic character Paste referred to the mo st sobering aspect of President Morty s return a s the realization that he s not so different from the Patrick Bate Morty we met in Rest and Ricklaxation two weeks ago Ruthless confident without a conscience and smarter than he gets credit for are all traits we ve seen embodied in Morty s ideal of himself and they all exist in President Morty who now seems like a possible culmination of the aforementioned long term moral development or atrophy of the Morty we know The Mary Sue praised the initial character concept as generator of a million theories wisely held back by the writers for moments of maximum punch describing their reintroduction as the perfect way to force the issue of our Morty s increased instability and keep things from reverting to the status quo before concluding that Justin Roiland sells the gravitas and magnetism of Eyepatch Morty well it s easy to forget that this is a character we know very little about beyond what could be extrapolated through the Rick he was controlling Given the opportunity to start from not quite scratch we re presented with a character who is inscrutable on a larger scale but understandable in the moment He s a chameleon and by his admission a believer in action It s a fantastic setup effectively deploying the return of the now infamous For the Damaged Coda backing track without feeling forced Since the release of Close Rick counters of the Rick Kind in March President Morty has become one of the most popular characters in the overall Rick and Morty franchise with several memes being made about him and life s most dramatic twists and turns in particular based around the For the Damaged Coda theme song Accolades and nominations Family tree References
