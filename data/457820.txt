Kramer has a GED Kramer was estranged for a long period from his mother Babs Kramer who works as a restroom matron at an upscale restaurant Unlike George and Jerry Kramer s character does not have a well developed network of family members shown in the sitcom He is the only main character on the show whose father never makes an appearance in The Chinese Woman Kramer mentions that he is the last male member of his family implying that his father had died He also mentions in The Lip Reader that he has or had a deaf cousin from whom he learned fluent American Sign Language He also has no children In The Strong Box it is revealed that Kramer spent a brief time in the Army although info about this time is classified In The Implant he says he lived in Los Angeles for three months Personality Though eccentric Kramer is generally caring friendly and kind hearted he often goes out of his way to help total strangers and tries to get his friends to also help others and to do the right thing even when they do not want to He is confident in his own unique way of doing things yet he can be neurotic and highly strung His quirkiness strange body movements and frequent gibberish mutterings have become his trademark He is also well liked by Jerry s parents whom he calls once a week as if he were their own son Kramer was originally envisioned as a recluse who never left his apartment except to visit Jerry This was the original reason behind why Kramer helps himself to Jerry s possessions and food without any pushback and also why he is absent from the season two episode The Chinese Restaurant which takes place entirely outside of the building However in season three Kramer starts to join Jerry Elaine and George in various scenes outside of the building As the series progresses Kramer completely loses any hints of reclusiveness and becomes one of the most extroverted characters on the show Kramer also gets his friends directly into trouble by talking them into unwise or even illegal actions such as parking in a disabled parking space The Handicap Spot urinating in a parking garage The Parking Garage committing mail fraud The Package or even hiring an assassin to get rid of a dog The Engagement Kramer is also known to mooch off his friends especially Jerry Kramer regularly enters and uses Jerry s apartment without knocking and often helps himself to Jerry s food Kramer also uses tools appliances of Jerry s only occasionally with permission and often returning them in a state of disrepair Kramer is known for his extreme honesty and lack of tact in The Nose Job he tells George s insecure girlfriend that she needs a nose job In The Kiss Hello Elaine tries to take advantage of this personality quirk by inviting Kramer to meet her friend Wendy whose hairstyle she feels is outdated Kramer rarely gets into trouble for his candor but his friends often do in The Cartoon Kramer makes comments to Sally Weaver who then blames Jerry for ruining her life as a result In general Kramer excels at persuading Jerry into doing things against his better judgment Kramer has displayed an almost unbending loyalty toward Jerry such as in The Millennium and The Bottle Deposit risking the failure of his own plans for Jerry s benefit Kramer also thought nothing of giving Jerry a large amount of his banked blood in The Blood In the same respect Jerry has helped Kramer out of good will and always seems to forgive and ultimately accept Kramer s mooching tendencies At times Jerry is entertained by Kramer s antics which may also be a factor in the friendship s endurance However Kramer is also quick to assume the worst of Jerry believing him guilty of everything from sabotaging a Miss America contestant in The Chaperone to having a double life as a Nazi leader in The Limo and is often oblivious to his sentiments In The Serenity Now an emotional Jerry declares a near brotherly love for Kramer and Kramer is not even prompted to look away from his current activity merely responding in a rote tone I love you too buddy He is close friends with Newman though like the main characters they frequently get into conflict with each other most notably in The Butter Shave in which Newman attempts to eat Kramer alive Their get rich quick schemes appear in The Old Man and The Bottle Deposit One of Kramer s friends Bob Sacamano is referred to by Kramer on several occasions yet never makes an onscreen appearance Sacamano is used as a source for several weird anecdotes nutty ideas or inaccurate information Lomez is another good friend of Kramer s who is mentioned yet never makes an appearance Kramer s apartment is the subject of numerous radical experiments in interior design Oftentimes the experiments never happen due to Kramer s inherent short attention span including his plan to eliminate all furniture and build levels like ancient Egypt in The Pony Remark He reconstructed the set of The Merv Griffin Show in The Merv Griffin Show Inside views of Kramer s apartment are seldom seen but it s known that he installed hardwood flooring and woodgrain like wallpaper to as he explains to Jerry give it the feel of a ski lodge The apartment is centered around a large hot tub and couch styled after a Chevy The apartment is decorated with many small statues of people all made entirely out of pasta Kramer has also experimented with his apartment entrance including reversing his peephole to prevent an ambush in The Reverse Peephole and installing a screen door in The Serenity Now Kramer enjoys smoking Cuban cigars In The Abstinence he sets up a smoking club in his apartment which included a regularly scheduled pipe night for those who preferred pipe tobacco to cigars and or cigarettes His face gets ruined after so much smoking and he hires Jackie Chiles to sue the cigarette company but instead gets his image as the Marlboro Man on the Marlboro billboard in Times Square He hires Cuban cigar rollers in an attempt to make his own Cuban cigars in The English Patient Kramer s conversation sometimes contains onomatopoeia or nonsensical sounds in order to stress an emotional point or describe earlier actions He sometimes expresses his agreement with a sentiment or suggestion via the word giddyup He indicates pleasure with Oh Mama and frustration or disgust with Oh yeah Of the four main characters Kramer has the fewest on screen romantic relationships He has no trouble attracting women but interactions with them usually begin and end with purely carnal encounters What few relationships he has are short lived Development Inspiration The character of Kramer was originally based on the real life Kenny Kramer a neighbor of co creator Larry David from New York However Michael Richards did not in any way base his performance on the real Kramer to the point of refusing to meet him This was later parodied in The Pilot when the actor that is cast to play him in Jerry and George s sitcom refuses to base the character on the real Cosmo Kramer At the time of the shooting of the original Seinfeld pilot The Seinfeld Chronicles Kenny Kramer had not yet given consent to use his name and so Kramer s character was originally known as Kessler Larry David was hesitant to use Kenny Kramer s real name because he suspected that Kramer would take advantage of this David s suspicion turned out to be correct Kenny Kramer created the Kramer Reality Tour a New York City bus tour that points out actual locations of events or places featured in Seinfeld The Kramer Reality Tour is itself spoofed on Seinfeld in The Muffin Tops In the episode when Kramer s real life stories are used by Elaine to pad the biography of J Peterman she was ghostwriting Kramer develops a reality bus tour called The Peterman Reality Tour and touts himself as The Real J Peterman Given and surnames Kramer was known only as Kramer during the show s first five seasons from to In The Seinfeld Chronicles Jerry referred to him as Kessler which was his original name for the show until it was changed to Kramer However in the first draft of the script he was named Hoffman In a flashback in The Betrayal Kramer says that his name is incorrectly listed as Kessler in the apartment building This retcons the pilot s use of Kessler as the character s name George finds out his first name of Cosmo through an encounter with Kramer s long estranged mom Babs in The Switch For the most part characters continued to call him Kramer for the remainder of the show s run The name Cosmo was suggested by Larry David he took the name from a boy who lived in the same apartment building as him and Kenny Kramer The episode titled The Bet would have revealed Kramer s first name as Conrad not Cosmo but it was never filmed
