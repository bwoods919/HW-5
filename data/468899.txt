novel he believes he is about to be arrested for murdering a colleague named Paul Allen Paul Owen in the novel and leaves a message on his lawyer s answering machine confessing to his crimes When he runs into his lawyer at a party however the man mistakes him for somebody else and tells him that the message must have been a joke as he had met with Allen only days earlier Bateman realizes that the punishment and notoriety he desires will be forever out of his reach and that he is trapped inside a meaningless existence This is not an exit Personality As written by Ellis Bateman is the ultimate stereotype of yuppie greed wealthy conceited and addicted to sex drugs and conspicuous consumption All of his friends look alike to him to the point that he often confuses one for another they often confuse him for other people as well Bateman delights in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his upper class lifestyle including designer clothes workout routine business cards alcoholic drinks elaborate high end stereo and home theater sound system He is engaged to an equally wealthy shallow woman named Evelyn Williams He has a mistress on the side named Courtney Lawrence the girlfriend of Luis Carruthers a closeted homosexual whom Bateman despises and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs many of whom end up being his victims The one woman and possibly the one person in his life for whom he has anything approaching feelings is his secretary Jean He feels that she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow so he cannot bring himself to seduce or kill her He casually acknowledges her as Jean my secretary who is in love with me and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he will probably end up married to someday Despite his affluence and high social status Bateman is plagued by feelings of anxiety and low self esteem He kills many of his victims because they make him feel inadequate usually by having better taste than he does He is hated by others as well his friends mock him as the boy next door his own lawyer refers to him as a bloody ass kisser a brown nosing goody goody and he is often dismissed as yuppie trash by people outside his social circle Bateman often expresses doubts regarding his own sanity and he has periodic attacks of psychosis during which he hallucinates It is left open to interpretation whether Bateman actually commits the acts he describes or whether he is merely hallucinating them he is therefore an unreliable narrator In the climax of the story Bateman calls his lawyer and leaves a lengthy detailed message confessing all of his crimes He later runs into his lawyer who mistakes him for someone else and dismisses the confession as a joke also claiming to have had dinner with one of his victims after Bateman had supposedly killed him leaving the supposed reality of Bateman s acts open to audience interpretation Although Bateman often claims that he is devoid of emotion he also describes experiencing moments of extreme rage panic or grief being on the verge of tears often over trivial inconveniences such as remembering to return videotapes or trying to obtain dinner reservations In the middle of dismembering a victim he breaks down sobbing that he just wants to be loved He takes psychotropics like Xanax to control these emotions He publicly espouses a philosophy of tolerance equality and traditional moral values because he thinks it will make him more likable but is in fact virulently racist homophobic and anti Semitic Bateman compensates for his anxiety through obsessive vanity and personal grooming with unwavering attention to detail He buys the most fashionable expensive clothing and accessories possible e g Salvatore Ferragamo Alan Flusser and Valentino suits Oliver Peoples glasses and Jean Paul Gaultier Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta leather goods as a means of effecting some control over his otherwise chaotic life Likewise he categorizes people by what they wear and how they look because they are more easily understood in terms of labels and stereotypes Bateman s apartment also is firmly controlled in terms of look and taste with the latest music food and art Bateman kills more or less indiscriminately with no preferred type of victim somewhat targeting any woman and man who gets in his way and no consistent or preferred method of killing Throughout the novel he kills men women animals and in one instance a child Bateman murders women mostly for sadistic sexual pleasure often during or just after sex He kills men because they upset or annoy him or make him feel inferior In the case of the child Bateman wished to see if he would enjoy it but found it unsatisfactory since the child s death would not affect as many people as an adult would Periodically he matter of factly confesses his crimes to his friends co workers and even complete strangers I like to dissect girls did you know I m utterly insane just to see if they are actually listening to him They either are not or they think that he is joking Outside American Psycho Bateman made his first appearance in Ellis s novel The
