new Fox series Writing style Story circle technique Harmon adapted the hero s journey a well known storytelling framework for use in television he calls this technique the story circle He began developing the technique while stuck on a screenplay in the late s and wanted to codify the storytelling process to unveil the structure that powers movies and TV shows He said I was thinking there must be some symmetry to this Some simplicity While working on Channel he found that many of the directors he was working with claimed that they were unable to write plots for television shows This prompted him to simplify Joseph Campbell s structure of the hero s journey into a circular eight step process that would reliably produce coherent stories The story circle can supposedly be applied to all stories Harmon uses it whenever he is writing a new story saying I can t not see that circle It s tattooed on my brain The circle is divided into eight segments each representing a stage of the plot a character is introduced wants something enters a new environment adapts to that environment achieves their goal encounters problems as a result of this leaves that world and is changed as a result He writes the steps as follows A character is in a zone of comfort or familiarity They desire something They enter an unfamiliar situation They adapt to that situation They get that which they wanted They pay a heavy price for it They return to their familiar situation They have changed as a result of the journey Campbell s structure of the hero s journey is the main influence in Harmon s technique In a blog post detailing the second sector of the circle Harmon explained The point of this part of the circle is our protagonist has been thrown into the water and now it s sink or swim In Hero with a Thousand Faces Campbell actually evokes the image of a digestive tract breaking the hero down divesting him of neuroses stripping him of fear and desire There s no room for bullshit in the unconscious basement Asthma inhalers eyeglasses credit cards fratty boyfriends promotions toupees and cell phones can t save you here The purpose here has become refreshingly and frighteningly simple The hero s journey has been adapted for screen and television writing before most notably by former Disney developmental executive Christopher Vogler in his book The Writer s Journey Mythic Structure for Writers Harmon has noted this book as an influence on the technique as well as the work of Syd Field Star Wars is an example of a film that consciously set out to use the hero s journey as a template for storytelling success Harmon states that this circular structure of storytelling can be applied both to film and TV suggesting in a Channel blog that only the final intentions are different A feature film s job is to send you out of the theatre on a high in minutes Television s job is to keep you glued to the television for your entire life This doesn t entail making stories any less circular TV circles are so circular they re sometimes irritatingly predictable It just means that the focus of step is less riling things up and more getting things back to where they started He has used the story circle technique extensively throughout projects such as Community and Rick and Morty In an interview with Collider writer Adam Chitwood said Rick and Morty debuted in to a serious degree of anticipation as it marked a new animated venture for Community creator Dan Harmon but it was the marriage of Harmon s adeptness for structure and character and co creator Justin Roiland s insanely creative sometimes insane mind that made Rick and Morty much more than just another animated TV series for adults Influences In an interview with Vulture Harmon named a number of films television shows books and artists that have shaped his writing style This includes the films RoboCop and Network the television shows Cheers Mr Show Arrested Development Second City Television and Twin Peaks the books Slaughterhouse Five and The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy the play Sexual Perversity in Chicago and writers artists and comedians including Garry Shandling George Lucas Spalding Gray Charlie Kaufman Woody Allen Tom Kenny and Chris Elliott In the same Vulture interview Harmon mentioned Dungeons Dragons musician Tori Amos and evolutionary anthropologist Elaine Morgan as influences He singled out Morgan s aquatic ape hypothesis calling it a peaceful interesting mythical concept and a scientific one that maybe the origin of Homo sapiens was kind of a fairy tale For Rick and Morty Harmon and co creator Justin Roiland listed a number of influences on the show s style including The Simpsons Ren Stimpy South Park Saturday Night Live The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Doctor Who and the cult sci fi film Zardoz Awards In July Harmon was nominated in two Emmy categories for his part in writing the st Academy Awards telecast Outstanding Writing for a Variety

Program as the executive producer of Rick and Morty He was also nominated with Chris McKenna for a Hugo award for writing the Community episode Remedial Chaos Theory Personal life In while writing the character Abed for Community Harmon realized through researching the character s traits that he might have Asperger syndrome He consulted a doctor about it and concluded that he himself is on the spectrum On a podcast hosted by Kevin Pollak he said I know I m not normal but I think the important thing is that I started to discover that I had a lot more in common with Abed than I did with Jeff
