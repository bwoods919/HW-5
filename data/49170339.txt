 A Rickle in Time is the first episode in the second season of the American animated television sitcom Rick and Morty and the twelfth overall episode of the series Written by Matt Roller and directed by Wes Archer the episode first aired on Adult Swim in the United States on July The title of the episode is a pun to the novel A Wrinkle in Time In the episode Rick Morty and his sister Summer having restarted time after freezing it in the season one finale Ricksy Business are in a quantum uncertain state of existence An argument leads to the creation of two alternate timelines which need to be stitched back together fast if they are to escape quantum collapse The episode s complex main story was the result of multiple revisions both in the writing and animation stage Many scenes were so visually dense the show s animation software could not render them A Rickle in Time received critical acclaim for its humor and elaborate storyline Though it was leaked online preceding its official premiere it was tied as the most watched cable program the night it first aired Plot Six months after Ricksy Business Rick decides to unfreeze time He warns Morty and Summer that their chronological time could initially be unstable Rick encourages Beth and Jerry to go out for ice cream to allow them time to stabilize Morty and Summer argue and the resulting uncertainty tears time apart into two realities depicted visually as two mostly synchronized parallel realities They are no longer a part of any timeline and the garage is surrounded by a black void filled with Schr dinger s cats Rick uses a Time Crystal to try to mend the timelines together but Morty and Summer s continued uncertainty prevents the fusion from working Rick s own uncertainty that his other self is conspiring against him results in chaos splitting the realities into four A four dimensional being with a testicle for a head appears and scolds Rick He gives Rick Morty and Summer time stabilizing collars that restore order by fusing the timelines into a single one However since Rick obtained the time crystal by illegal means the being tells them that they will go to Time Prison for eternity Rick instructs Morty and Summer to break off their collars but the resulting chain of uncertainty further splits their realities into dozens of different realities After defeating the testicle monster Rick notes that time is falling apart Summer s collar transports her back to her time but one of the Mortys collars is broken With the garage falling away piece by piece the Morty with the broken collar falls into the spaceless void and Rick jumps after him but Morty dropped his collar so Rick gives Morty his collar and accepts death but quickly changes his mind as he spots Morty s collar floating below him He hurriedly fixes it and all three are reunited in their own time Meanwhile after getting ice cream Beth and Jerry hit a deer with their car As an animal surgeon Beth attempts to help the deer at a veterinary hospital but notices a gunshot wound in its side A hunter appears and claims the deer as his calling a lawyer to guarantee his ownership While Beth ignores this and attempts to save the deer Jerry comes to the rescue by bringing members of a wildlife institute who can transport the deer to the best doctors and outside the jurisdiction of the hunter s claim Back in the woods Jerry reveals the men were not doctors but rather employees at the ice cream parlor Beth continues her operation and saves the deer who returns to the woods After the credits an additional scene shows the testicle monster receiving reinforcements They mistake Albert Einstein for Rick and proceed to beat him up and warn him not to mess with time This inspires Einstein to formulate the theory of relativity to spite them Production Writing Co creator Justin Roiland was adamant that episode one of season two pick up where its predecessor left off co creator Dan Harmon also remembered he toyed around with the idea of freezing time for the entire length of the season There was talk of the frozen time conceit being just a joke for a cold open but the writers decided to expand it to the entire episode with Roiland saying Okay let s try to actually do that and try to tell a whole story that shows why time is sort of problematic It was difficult because instead of parodying subverting a trope a common path for many episodes the writers essentially had to invent their own rules for fractured time An early incarnation involved Morty and Summer going about frozen time when they are confronted a time policeman which evolved into the time traveling testicle monsters These characters were originally inspired by Stephen King s miniseries The Langoliers This version was cut because they deemed it too basic with nowhere to go for a potential second act One deleted element of the splitting time was referring to it as a time quake an early version featured Rick berating Morty for wearing shorty shorts which caused time to split The reason for the fractured time was ultimately re developed into something more specific to the characters At first chaos as a whole was responsible for the split time but they decided on uncertainty as a cause solely to serve a joke about flathead Phillips head screwdrivers When you re talking about how to define chaos let alone uncertainty that s when you get into a semantic spiral producer Ryan Ridley said Harmon felt it a suitable source for the time split because uncertainty was an intersection between quantum physics and the human condition The team was happy when they created the joke that Rick believes his parallel self is plotting to kill him because it felt like we were writing a cartoon The earliest incarnation of the B story involved Rick taking Beth and Jerry and placing them amongst a sea of random individuals on an island or parking garage to occupy them Harmon characterized it as an homage to event programming such as Lost It was re developed because they felt such series fizzle out or end unresolved which would not help the episode comedically Another version fused the episode s B story more prominently with its A story in that when a time quake would occur Beth and Jerry would unknowingly experience repeated moments and their settings would change between the past present and future In the end the A story was so complex already that they chose to create an independent narrative for the B story To this end Roiland felt that the writers probably could have done a little better on that half of the show Animation Roiland characterized the episode as brutal to story board and animate Director Wes Archer his brother Martin Archer and Scott Alberts storyboarded multiple different versions of the episode Archer estimated its opening was re developed three or four times Their first thumbnail pass took two weeks with the first full animatic taking an additional three weeks At this point the team realized the episode was not working Harmon wrote another draft and the writing team stayed up all night pitching jokes for it It was then sent off to Archer and his team for another animatic They were able to reuse a lot but they had to go in and re board a bunch of stuff and they were troopers the whole way through Never once did they complain said Roiland This alternate version labeled Attempt was released on the season two Blu ray and DVD sets The show is animated in the software Toon Boom Harmony which kept crashing constantly during the episode s production This was due in large part to the shots where ultimately separate realities play out onscreen The overload of layers and elements would cause the software to crash The final episode was the result of multiple composited shots stitched together They basically had to output it and then rotoscope over the top of it in order to get the final fixes in Roiland said There are subtle differences in several but not all duplicated shots When the in house animation unit for Rick and Morty would receive shots back from their international partner Bardel Entertainment they would attempt to edit shots further for more variety To finalize single shots a computer would have to be out of service for nearly fourteen hours to complete rendering In one instance a layer went missing nearing the end of a shot necessitating another full composite At the time of its post production Harmon was working on the sixth season of Community and Roiland was really wishing he was here for this particular episode The episode s troubled production put the entire season behind schedule Reception A Rickle in Time alongside the second episode of the second season Mortynight Run leaked online one month before its television premiere Roiland noted that it was ripped from a press only site with subtle audio and animation errors that would be fixed in the final version On the ethics of watching the leaked episodes Roiland commented I will say this I don t think that any fans or even non fans that end up watching it are villainous I don t think anyone should beat themselves up too bad for doing it but it s more of a bummer that someone else made the decision to put it out into the world before it was ready Upon its premiere on television the episode received a rating and was watched by a total of million people making it tied as the most watched show on cable that night A Rickle in Time received critical acclaim from television critics Zack Handlen reviewing for the episode for The A V Club praised its incredibly clever and visually stunning central gimmick writing that the episode enhances what he finds is the show s genius it finds time for absurdity and sincerity with both enhancing rather than undermining the other IGN writer Jesse Schedeen dubbed the episode truly memorable summarizing it thusly It reminded us why this show is so unique The time splitting conflict was cleverly executed and grew progressively more hilarious Not only that it wrapped up on a surprisingly poignant note Gita Jackson of Paste gave the episode at commenting There s thought here there s polish they want to make sure you can see the work put into this Roiland and Harmon were convinced the episode was a mess It went off the deep end conceptually and got really over complicated said Harmon It broke us to a certain extent We were so close to something amazing and we never really got there from a structural standpoint Roiland said References Footnotes Sources External links A Rickle in Time Rick and Morty Season
