starts singing the song Goodbye Moonmen with an accompanying psychedelic music video in Morty s head Gearhead betrays Rick by calling the authorities who Fart says want to use their ability to alter the composition of atoms Rick Morty and Fart are chased by law enforcement as they leave until Fart uses telepathy to distract them Fart reaches a wormhole and tells Morty that their plan is to destroy all carbon based life which they consider to be pathogens Morty induces Fart to sing again and ultimately kills them with the antimatter gun Rick and Morty then return to pick up Jerry but another Rick and Morty are confused over which Jerry corresponds to who and they each leave with a random one of the two Jerrys In a post credits scene Rick appears in a Blips and Chitz advert Production The episode officially debuted on August on Adult Swim However along with the previous episode A Rickle in Time an advanced copy sent to reviewers was leaked online prior to the premiere This version had inferior audiovisual quality and lacked last minute animation fixes although creator Justin Roiland said that the average person wouldn t really know the difference In art director James McDermott published some concept art for the episode He said that he made a wet and steamy design for the suspicious space garage where Rick meets Krombopulos Michael and drew an unused character Krootch who was originally intended to be a procurer that tries to trick Jerry when he leaves the daycare Krootch was discarded after Harmon decided the environment should be more chaotic and scary According to Roiland a collection of rocks that Rick is seen collecting at the end of the episode contain a parasite pod visible as a pink blob which goes on to cause the parasite infestation of two episodes later Total Rickall In the latter episode Rick can be seen disposing of the rocks A video of Roiland reading some alternate jokes proposed in the writers room for Mortynight Run was released in In a video creator Dan Harmon described how both the main plot and side plot Mortynight Run fit into the eight step story circle technique he uses for writing Goodbye Moonmen is featured on The Rick and Morty Soundtrack It was composed by Ryan Elder who was given the lyrics and the description Fart sings a David Bowie inspired song the final song imitated Bowie s psychedelic imagery and nonsense lyrics After listening to Bowie for several hours Elder composed the song using a guitar in a couple of hours Jemaine Clement the voice actor for Fart recorded his dialogue locally in New Zealand with direction from the producers According to Elder there was around minutes left in the session for him to record Goodbye Moonmen and his first rendition was the version used in the final episode The comic Rick and Morty follows the life of Krombopulos Michael from one of his first assassination jobs to his death Analysis Mortynight Run is the first episode to use Morty s name in the title though previous titles incorporate Rick s name The arcade Blips and Chitz briefly reoccurs in the season four episode Never Ricking Morty Josh Wilbur of Wired said time passing more quickly inside another world in Roy years for Morty pass within minutes is a common trope in science fiction Other examples include The Inner Light a Star Trek The Next Generation episode in which Captain Picard experiences decades as another person in minutes and White Christmas a Black Mirror instalment where a digital copy of a person is made to experience years passing per minute Paste s Gita Jackson said the moral of the episode is that we understand so little about the world that we live in rather than the more negative message life is inherently pain This is shown through Fart s justification for destroying all carbon based life and Jerry s inability to understand the world he finds when leaving the daycare The A V Club s Zack Handlen said the episode challenges the obvious notion of Rick as a coldhearted bastard and Morty as a sweet good natured kid This is because the moral decision is not always the obvious one and Rick understands situations better than characters like Morty Also Morty s character growth shows that he could be designed for change while Jerry s experience shows that he is not Emily Reuben of Looper said the episode contained two discontinuities the way Rick kills several guards by flooding the room should not have been possible due to a hole that Morty created on his initial crash into the room and the cargo in the back of Rick s ship in the opening scene inexplicably changes Reception The episode was watched by million viewers when it first aired on Adult Swim Rating it out of Jesse Scheeden of IGN believed that the game Roy was a standout and showed the writers attention to detail Schedeen approved of Morty s character growth the distinctive voice and personality that Clement brought to Fart and that Jerry s subplot was linked to the main storyline amusing and had a good resolution Giving it a score of out of Paste s Gita Jackson wrote that the episode was humorous particularly the density of jokes at Blips and Chitz and Fart s incorrect word choices after reading the other characters minds Zack Handlen of The A V Club graded the episode A despite experiencing an initial disappointment at a lack of surprise on the scale of previous episodes On reflection Handlen found it solid even necessary storytelling for the series for its character development of Morty He also approved of subtle touches throughout and Clement s voice acting as Fart a character just likable enough for his eventual disintegration to matter References External links Mortynight Run at IMDb
