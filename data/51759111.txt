God however Rick is later established to be aware of the existence of various afterlives and gods just lacking respect for them Harmon has said that anarchist is a close ideological descriptor of Rick One of the show s creators and executive producers and voice actor Justin Roiland revealed Sanchez was pansexual This was shown in Auto Erotic Assimilation when Rick re connects with Unity an ex lover who is a collective hive mind of assimilated individuals from the planet they occupy Rick is further shown to be attracted to planets in the Oni Press comic series backup story Rick and Morty in The Most Important Lesson Rick is further established to be attracted to sentient planets which later serves as the basis for the fourth season episode Childrick of Mort where Rick re connects with ex lover Gaia a planet whom he met on a Planets Only dating website Development The character was created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon who first met at Channel in the early s In Roiland created The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti an animated short parodying the Back to the Future characters Emmett Doc Brown and Marty McFly and the precursor to Rick and Morty The idea for Rick and Morty in the form of Doc and Mharti was brought up to Adult Swim and the ideas for a family element and Rick being a grandfather to Morty were developed Roiland considers his voice for Rick to be a horrible Doc Brown manic impression I was having fun doing these really crappy Doc Brown and Marty McFly impressions During the middle of a line a burp came out naturally said Roiland addressing the creation of Rick s ubiquitous burping habit Addressing Roiland s and his own portrayals of Rick in a series of promotional interstitials directed by Paul B Cummings compared to Doc Brown Christopher Lloyd stated that he felt like Doc and Rick were like two brothers that took different paths Reception The character has received positive reception Speaking of Rick s relatability and likability Dan Harmon stated that we ve all been Rick But Rick really does have bigger fish to fry than anybody He understands everything better than us So you give him the right to be jaded and dismissive and narcissistic and sociopathic Emily Gaudette of Inverse wrote that fans have come to love Rick over two seasons of misadventures David Sims of The Atlantic noted Rick s bitter amorality and called the character a genius who comfortably thinks of himself as the universe s cleverest man and is grounded only by his empathy toward other people which he tries to suppress as much as possible therefore writing that Rick s selflessness at the end of the episode The Wedding Squanchers is the most surprising twist possible Zack Handlen of The A V Club wrote that Rick slowly realizing that he loved his grandkids and his daughter and tolerated his son in law no matter how many times he swore at them helped to give the character some necessary depth and that behind all the catchphrases and the crazed energy There s something dead and sad and fucked up in the guy In popular culture Rick appears in the couch gag of the The Simpsons episode Mathlete s Feat with Roiland reprising his role In the first episode of the third season The Rickshank Redemption Rick shows a significant interest in Schezwan sauce and insists that his motivation in life is finding that McNugget sauce caused a public interest in having the sauce be reinstated on the McDonald s menu with some fans attempting to recreate the sauce themselves According to USA Today McDonald s spokesperson Terri Hickey stated that We never say never because when our customers speak we listen And to paraphrase some of our most enthusiastic fans our sauce is so good that it would be worth waiting seasons or years for In March Godzilla King of the Monsters director Michael Dougherty confirmed the character of Monarch crypto sonographer Dr Rick Stanton played by Bradley Whitford was based on Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty with Dougherty having the character drink a lot to keep the character in line with the spirit of Sanchez In Rick appears in Fortnite Battle Royale as part of the Chapter Season Battle Pass in Multiversus as part of the game s first season and in the film Space Jam A New Legacy with Roiland reprising his role Rick appears in the Half in the Bag episode Jayus Ex Mikeina from Red Letter Media with Roiland reprising
