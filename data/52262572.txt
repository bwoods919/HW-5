suspicious that she has no negative memories of Mr Poopybutthole shoots him However he is real and severely injured by the shot In a post credits scene the Smith family watch Mr Poopybutthole in physical therapy he tells a nurse to pass the message onto Beth that he is sorry she had no negative memories of him Production According to writer Ryan Ridley the episode is named after Total Recall a science fiction film that features false memory implantation but was conceived by Mike McMahan with reference to the fifth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer In this season the character Dawn Summers is introduced and treated by other characters as if she has always been present a supernatural reason for this is eventually given Another writer suggested this was a good format for a clip show spoof where flashbacks would be essential to the plot Mr Poopybutthole was originally Bullet Boy a character resembling a bullet and was informed by creator Justin Roiland s prior design sketch of a character called Titty Longballs Justin Roiland said that the parasite infestation originates from rocks that Rick is seen collecting two episodes earlier in Mortynight Run A pink blob the parasite pod can be seen on a rock in Mortynight Run and Rick bins the rocks at the start of Total Rickall One flashback shows Rick about to bulk purchase limited edition The Legend of Zelda themed Nintendo DS consoles with the plan to resell them at a higher price This was based on Roiland doing this several years earlier shortly before the December premiere of the pilot episode but he still had a number of consoles unsold In he sold one of them online alongside a handdrawn picture of Rick and Morty A clay animation special released in depicts Mr Poopybutthole as traumatized after Beth shot him and worried that he will not be able to resume his pommel horse practice A web special released at the end of season three shows Mr Poopybutthole looking through a scrapbook of his life including significant life events involving his wife and child On April Fools Day Adult Swim rebranded themselves as Adult Swim Junior and debuted a redubbed version of Total Rickall where the voice actors were children A new opening credits sequence showed the main characters as babies and some of the dialogue such as profanity was adapted with Mr Poopybutthole renamed to Mr Poopybuttbutt A third version debuted for the next year s April Fools Day as one of a series of altered shows with glitches related to Learning with Pibby a proof of concept short produced by Cartoon Network Studios that was released on Adult Swim s YouTube channel in October The party game Rick and Morty Total Rickall Card Game adapts characters from the episode into roles for each player A number of players are imposters and the remaining characters aim to identify and eliminate these imposters Analysis The episode s plot resembles the film The Thing wherein a parasitic life form causes a group of researchers to doubt each other s existence It is similar to another television episode that Harmon worked on Community s Paradigms of Human Memory in which characters flashbacks show unseen content An episode of Clerks The Animated Series also had a similar premise Corey Plante of Inverse wrote that the improvisational style resembled the episodes Rixty Minutes and Interdimensional Cable Tempting Fate but that it was most similar to Morty s Mind Blowers because it is a clip show of flashbacks Plante highlighted that Total Rickall is one of the earliest points at which Morty is the one to solve the difficult situation the characters are in With one main storyline and a setting confined to the Smith household the episode is more limited in scope than others In the opening titles Mr Poopybutthole can be seen inserted into each title sequence Subsequent to this episode Mr Poopybutthole reappears a number of times in post credits scenes Creator Dan Harmon proposed that Mr Poopybutthole could be an advanced creature who survives by taking advantage of the holes in people s memories that the parasites leave and that this could explain his ability to break the fourth wall MatPat on his YouTube channel The Film Theorists proposed that Mr Poopybutthole is a version of Morty from an alternate universe He cites as evidence details from Mr Poopybutthole s scrapbook in the web special Jerry s love for Sleepy Gary led to fan speculation about his sexuality In the season five episode Mort Dinner Rick Andre Jerry similarly expresses sexual interest in a male character relishing the possibility of a threesome with his wife and Mr Nimbus Reception The episode first aired on Adult Swim on August where it was watched by million viewers Inverse s Corey Plante reviewed that the episode manages to incorporate each of the best aspects of Rick and Morty particularly praising the cold opening and Sleepy Gary s character as humorous and Beth shooting Mr Poopybutthole as unforgettable Commenting on Morty s revelation that a character is real if he shares negative memories with them Plante said that this thoughtful commentary on the messiness of life and family is universally relatable Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the episode out of praising that the premise allowed each flashback to have plot relevance and that watching the Smith family try to work out if each other was real was funny Schedeen approved of the large number of guest voice actors particularly Keith David as Reverse Giraffe but criticized the ending for not giving more significant focus to the emotional fallout of having years of cherished memories revealed to be false and hollow Zack Handlen of The A V Club who gave the episode an A similarly praised the premise along with the rapid pace of the episode and lack of a distracting subplot A number of critics found Total Rickall one of the strongest episodes of television in including David Sims of The Atlantic Alec Bojalad of Den of Geek and Steve Greene of IndieWire References External links Total Rickall at IMDb
