a cyborg dubbed Phoenix Person Production The Rickshank Rickdemption was written by staff team member Mike McMahan Elements of the episode were loosely inspired by the film The Shawshank Redemption and features the series trademark dark humor nihilism and multiverse based plot line In a segment for the Den of Geek website series creator Dan Harmon said The Rickshank Rickdemption would resolve the conflicts that originated from the second season According to Harmon I don t think anybody wants to do a third season that simply spends a whole bunch of episodes dealing with a situation that we created at the end of the second season so I think that s a non spoiler way of saying things should be okay pretty quickly The episode marks the reappearance of several former key plot developments including the Cronenberg universe the Citadel of Ricks and Birdperson The third season premiere of Rick and Morty was expected to arrive as early as However Harmon admitted in a conversation with Indiewire that new episodes were becoming more difficult to create because of artistic disagreements with co creator Justin Roiland Writing for The Rickshank Rickdemption commenced on November a few months later in February episode director Juan Meza Leon began work for the project s sound recording In February to celebrate the beginning of the episode s animation phase Adult Swim Australia
