id: 5451605
The Simpsons opening sequence is the title sequence of the American animated television series The Simpsons It is accompanied by The Simpsons Theme The first episode to use this introduction was the series second episode Bart the Genius Each episode has the same basic sequence of events the camera zooms through cumulus clouds through the show s title towards the town of Springfield The camera then follows the members of the Simpson family on their way home Upon entering their house the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode Bart writes different phrases on the school chalkboard Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone or occasionally a different instrument and different visual gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch The standard opening has had two major revisions The first was at the start of the second season when the entire sequence was reanimated to improve the quality and certain shots were changed generally to add characters who had been established in the first season The second was a brand new opening sequence produced in high definition for the show s transition to that format beginning with Take My Life Please in season The new opening generally followed the sequence of the original opening with improved graphics even more characters and new jokes Sequence This sequence opens with the show s title in yellow approaching the camera through misty cumulus clouds in a dark blue sky The shot cuts through the counter in the letter P to an establishing shot of the town of Springfield The camera zooms in through the town toward a lavender Springfield Elementary and then through a window to a lavender classroom where Bart is writing lines on the chalkboard as a punishment and three drawings are seen on the wall When the school bell rings Bart leaves in a hurry and skateboards out of the school doors The shot cuts to Homer working at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant wearing a safety mask while handling a glowing green rod of uranium with a pair of silver tongs An unknown co worker in the background eats a sandwich with another pair of tongs The end of shift whistle blows and Homer immediately takes off his mask and drops his tongs to leave work As he does so the uranium rod bounces into the air and falls down the back of his radiation suit The next shot shows Marge and Maggie checking out at a supermarket Maggie who is sitting on the conveyor belt is inadvertently scanned along with the groceries as Marge reads a magazine Maggie is rung up at a price of US representing the monthly cost of raising a child at the time and bagged Marge frantically looks around for Maggie as the bag is dropped into her shopping cart which startles her and makes her turn around then breathes a sigh of relief when she pops up from the bag Lisa is shown next at band practice The opening theme coordinates with this shot and is orchestrated as if it were played by the school band Mr Largo stops the rest of the band to order Lisa out of the rehearsal for her unorthodox playing of her saxophone which is light blue in this sequence but gold in the episode She continues to improvise on her way out of the room Shots of the family on their way home to Evergreen Terrace are then shown As Homer drives through Springfield he fumbles behind his neck pulls the uranium rod out of his shirt collar and throws it out the car window As it bounces off the curb near Moe s Tavern Bart skateboards past noticing a bank of televisions in a store window he passes showing Krusty the Clown he then passes a bus stop and unwittingly steals its sign The five unknown characters waiting at the stop then chase after a bus that fails to stop for them As soon as Bart crosses the road a car drives past and Maggie is seen inside at the steering wheel The camera alternates between close ups of her jerking the wheel back and forth and the car veering wildly it then zooms out to reveal that her wheel is only a toy Marge is actually driving the car and Maggie imitates her horn honking Lisa then rides her bicycle down the street her books and saxophone case strapped into the front basket and the back of her seat respectively when she hits a bump the books are briefly jolted upward but held down by the straps Lisa is the first to arrive at home as the garage door opens jumping off her bike with her things letting it roll into the garage and running for the front door Homer pulls into the driveway and parks after which Bart bounces his skateboard off the car roof and follows Lisa toward the door When Homer steps out of the car he screams at the sight of Marge s car approaching and runs into the garage the shot switches briefly to Marge s perspective as he escapes through a door into the house and she stops just short of crashing into the wall The family members then enter the living room from different directions creating a segue into the couch gag and finally the creator and developers credits shown on the television screen Notably in Bart the Genius the famous high pitched scream of Homer s when he runs from Marge s car into the house is cut The scream is added in the third episode Homer s Odyssey For the second season the original opening was reanimated Most shots were very closely copied with some shots such as Homer s first shot appearing to be traced The coloring was changed on most shots and the characters and animation were cleaned up Some scenes were replaced or modified In Bart s chalkboard gag the school is now orange with purple accents instead of lavender the classroom is now olive green instead of lavender there are desks a red wastebasket and a bookshelf in the background and a photo of Homer as George Washington and a clock are seen on walls In Homer s first shot at the power plant Homer s tongs are now orange instead of silver and Mr Burns and Smithers study certain plans in the background in place of the unknown co worker When the end of shift whistle blows Mr Burns checks his wristwatch to see if it is working he then starts shaking it suggesting that it isn t working When Bart skateboards down the sidewalk the scenery is different the bank of televisions is changed and shorter and Bart no longer notices them Instead he weaves in between a series of secondary characters who crowd the sidewalk and then crosses the road near Moe s Tavern earning the ire of Chief Wiggum This segment is notably shorter than the original bus stop segment Lisa s bike ride is cut and instead upon Marge and Maggie honking their horns there is a whip pan across the town featuring a significant number of secondary characters towards the Simpsons house Homer reaches the house first instead of Lisa and Bart bounces his skateboard off the car and rolls toward the front door Homer leaves his car and has to dodge Lisa as she pedals up the driveway following Bart without dismounting from her bike The difference in the driveway scene is that Lisa s saxophone is no longer in the case but on the back of her bike Finally the family television has been redesigned to give it a more retro style than in season Since this season there have been some episodes that had the opening sequence start from the driveway scene After the first half of season a yell of D oh of Homer s when he dodges Lisa on her bike was added Starting with season the new arrangement of the opening theme is used throughout the intro present The new opening sequence was animated for the show s transition to the High Definition format premiering with the season episode Take My Life Please This sequence is similar to the previous one but features many visual changes that take advantage of the wider format The sequence opens as usual with movement through cumulus clouds while something random flies by In some high definition episodes the beginning just shows the title and cuts through the counter in the P similar to the past sequences The camera then zooms past the nuclear power plant and into the town square where Jimbo and Kearney saw off the head of the statue of Jebediah Springfield a callback to The Telltale Head which falls onto the head of Ralph who is holding an ice cream cone As it falls on him he inadvertently tosses the cone into the statue s eye Then in selected episodes from How the Test Was Won to Moe Letter Blues he says a few words after the head falls on him The camera then weaves through several buildings and structures featuring a billboard gag towards Springfield Elementary and zooms through the familiar window where Bart writes lines as punishment on the chalkboard In the background the wastebasket is now dark green instead of red And the picture on the wall is Homer as an astronaut instead of George Washington When the bell rings and Bart skateboards out of the school doors plowing into a pile of leaves raked up by Groundskeeper Willie while landing on and exposing Barney who is buried underneath which also causes him to belch Homer is shown at the power plant and in the background Lenny Leonard is standing on a ladder changing the number of days without an accident on the sign from to When the end at shift whistle blows Lenny falls off the ladder onto Carl Carlson who is securing the bottom of the ladder and as in the previous opening sequences the green uranium rod falls into Homer s clothing as he leaves The scene changes to Marge at the supermarket checkout with her older twin sisters Patty and Selma Among the products Marge is buying is Tomacco juice Mr Sparkle detergent and Krusty O s cereal Maggie is scanned and the price doubles from US to US before she is put in the shopping cart When Maggie pops her head out of the paper bag Marge looks relatively calm and does not panic unlike in the previous sequences Maggie shakes her fist at Baby Gerald who is beside her in another shopping cart and Baby Gerald shakes his fist too At band practice Mr Largo dismisses Lisa who plays a solo as she leaves and then pokes her head back in the door to finish it One notable difference from the previous opening sequences is Sherri and Terri who are texting messages instead of playing their flutes Another one is that Bart s classmates Martin and Wendell appear in the background Also Lisa s saxophone is now gold like during almost every episode instead of light blue and she is occasionally depicted playing a different instrument trumpet harp etc Homer is then shown driving home and discards the stuck uranium rod out the window it lands in Otto s lap and he eats it Bart skateboards past Otto before weaving through several townspeople a machete swinging Sideshow Bob Helen Lovejoy Apu and his octuplets Moe Comic Book Guy Disco Stu the Crazy Cat Lady the Rich Texan and Chief Wiggum who shakes his baton at Bart as Bart crosses the road Hans Moleman pokes his head out from a manhole which slams down on him when Marge drives over it in her car Marge is now driving an orange station wagon instead of a red sedan reflecting the change in the show Maggie is shown in a booster seat in the middle while Grampa sleeps next to her When Marge and Maggie honk their respective horns Grampa is startled awake and his dentures fall out The camera then pans across Springfield and then cuts to the driveway scene Unlike the other two opening sequences Marge s car now hits Homer and carries him on the hood until it stops short flinging him ahead to smash a Homer shaped hole through the door The couch gag is shown before the credits are displayed on a new wall mounted widescreen plasma television which sometimes falls off and breaks or in some episodes the credits are presented in another way Notably in Take My Life Please the loud belch of Barney s when Bart plows into him is cut The belch was added in the sixth HD episode Wedding for Disaster In the th episode the opening sequence was a montage of all previous couch gags pulling back into a photomosaic of the number ending with Homer strangling Bart both wearing tuxedos saying his famous quote Why you little Some episodes since season do not feature an opening sequence at all instead it cuts from the clouds to the start of the episode Season was the first season to not include shots of the family on their way home Season was the first season to only include chalkboard gags the driveway scene and couch gags and Season was the first season to exclude the chalkboard gags at the beginning of each episode The full length opening sequence returned in the season finale episode Homer s Adventures Through the Windshield Glass Development and variations Creator Matt Groening developed a lengthy opening sequence for the first season of The Simpsons in order to cut down on the animation necessary for each episode but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week In the first of the original gags the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School where Bart can be seen writing a message on the chalkboard This message which changes from episode to episode has become known as the chalkboard gag The other gag is known as a couch gag in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television Groening who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time The episode Bart the Genius was the first to feature the series full title sequence The theme which plays over the sequence was composed by Danny Elfman in after Groening approached him requesting a retro style theme The piece which took two days to create has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career The season two episode Bart Gets an F featured a revised opening sequence and a rearranged version of the theme which was shortened by fifteen seconds from its original length of roughly seconds The opening sequence for the first season showed Bart stealing a Bus Stop sign whilst the new sequence featured him skateboarding past several characters who had been introduced during the previous season Starting with this season there were three versions of the opening a full roughly minute second long version a second long version and a second long version This gave the show s editors more leeway The current arrangement of the theme by Alf Clausen was introduced in season Take My Life Please was the first episode of The Simpsons to air in p high definition television though not the first time The Simpsons appeared in high definition as The Simpsons Movie was rendered in HD This episode was the first to feature the new opening sequence It was the first major permanent change to the show s introduction since the opening added in season two previous changes have included variations in the duration of the intro and special one shot introductions for the Treehouse of Horror Halloween episodes as well as a handful of others This new intro also includes some D animation when the camera pans over Springfield The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told the New York Post The clouds at the very beginning of the main title were always unsatisfying to me My original direction to the animators was to make the clouds as realistic as possible and as we go through the clouds we enter this cartoon universe of The Simpsons Finally after a couple of decades they ve gotten closer to what I had in my mind Not perfect but better The two original variations were further expanded to these variations Something different flies past the show s logo in the clouds at the start of the intro since The billboard in front of the elementary school changes since Bart writes something different on the chalkboard in every episode Lisa may play a different solo on her saxophone or on a different instrument entirely Homer s scream changes as he dodges Marge first two seasons only The Simpsons attempt to sit on the couch as something goes awry in an often surreal manner In the intro Ralph says something different when the head of Jebediah Springfield falls on him selected episodes in season and season At the end of the sequence the TV set sometimes comes loose from its wall mount and smashes on the floor since Billboard gag The billboard gag is a running visual joke added to the opening sequence with the updated high definition opening In the gag a billboard is seen on the roof of the building across the street from the elementary school as the camera pans through the town The billboard changes every episode The first episode with a billboard gag was Take My Life Please where the billboard says Krusty Now Doing Funerals Chalkboard gag The chalkboard gag is a running visual joke that occurs during the opening credits of many episodes In this gag Bart Simpson is writing lines on the chalkboard as a punishment when the school bell rings he immediately stops writing and runs out of the classroom The phrase he writes on the chalkboard changes from episode to episode Chalkboard messages may involve political humor such as The First Amendment does not cover burping pop culture references such as I can t see dead people The Sixth Sense and I was not the sixth Beatle and meta references such as I am not a year old woman in reference to Bart s voice actress Nancy Cartwright and Nobody reads these anymore When possible Bart is shown deliberately disobeying the line that he is writing on the chalkboard e g squeaking chalk when asked to write I will not squeak chalk putting in ditto marks for I will not cut corners showing dis coordination with coffee is not for kids or putting I will finish what I sta for a single line In The Simpsons Movie the gag I will not illegally download this movie is a reference to piracy In MyPods and Boomsticks the couch gag was the family finding Bart writing I will not bring the chalkboard home on a chalkboard in front of the couch The animators are able to produce the chalkboard gags quickly and in some cases have changed them to fit current events For example the chalkboard gag for Homer the Heretic reads I will not defame New Orleans The gag had been written as an apology to the city for a controversial song in the previous week s episode which called the city a home of pirates drunks and whores Another such chalkboard line gave the creators stance on the threats made towards another popular animated sitcom South Park by the group Revolution Muslim following the controversies with the episodes and and the depictions of Muslim prophet Mohammed South Park We d stand beside you if we weren t so scared Many episodes do not feature a chalkboard gag because they are cut to make more room for story plot development and advertisements In Four Regrettings and a Funeral season Bart writes We ll really miss you Mrs K only once in tribute to the recent death of Marcia Wallace the voice of Edna Krabappel In the first episode to air after Donald Trump won the United States presidential election in Bart writes Being right sucks a reference to the episode Bart to the Future where Lisa succeeds Trump as Commander in Chief Chalkboard gags have not been featured since Season Lisa s solo During the opening sequence Lisa is seen being expelled from band rehearsal due to her non conformist saxophone playing She exits the room playing a saxophone solo which from the third season onward sometimes changes Some of the solos have similarities with pieces by Donovan Frank Zappa James Brown and Charlie Parker The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen said that the session musicians who perform her solos do not try to play at the second grade level and instead think of Lisa as a really good player Lisa plays the baritone saxophone but according to Matt Groening she doesn t always play a baritone sax because the animators don t know what it looks like so it changes shape and color from show to show After the switch to HD production Lisa has also occasionally performed her solo on an instrument other than the saxophone As of season she has played a trumpet a violin a fiddle a tuba a baritone horn a clarinet a theremin and a harp In this last instance she drags the instrument with her and continues playing once Mr Largo orders her out of the room Whenever she plays a different instrument she takes it with her while riding home on her bike Lisa s solo has been cut from opening sequences since Season Couch gag The couch gag is a running visual joke near the end of the opening credits The gag generally changes from episode to episode and usually features the Simpson family s living room couch A typical gag features the Simpson family running into the living room only to find some abnormality with the couch be it a bizarre and unexpected occupant an odd placement of the couch such as on the ceiling or any number of other situations In the syndicated version for the episodes from seasons to the couch gag for the episode is usually replaced with the one from season five s Rosebud where The Simpsons find an exact double of themselves on the couch though the syndicated versions of the later episodes retain their original couch gags The couch gag is frequently used to make the show longer or shorter depending on the length of the episode itself For example longer couch gags have been used to fill time in shorter episodes such as in Lisa s First Word I Love Lisa The Front Cape Feare Fear of Flying Monty Can t Buy Me Love Simpson Safari and The Bart Wants What It Wants where the family dances in a kickline with women resembling The Rockettes An extended couch gag was also seen in the first episode to use the new opening sequence Take My Life Please where the family chases their couch on a tour across the world Another long couch gag was in the show s th episode At Long Last Leave showing a montage of previous couch gags Other versions Some episodes feature an opening sequence with a different theme Live action In the British television channel Sky One began advertising The Simpsons using a live action recreation of the series opening sequence directed by Chris Palmer With the exception of the very first shot in which the logo appears out of the clouds every piece of the opening is present in this version with even multiple chalkboard and couch gags filmed Attached to the end of this sequence is the message Come home to The Simpsons on Sky One The recreation was used instead of the regular opening sequence in the season episode Homer Simpson This Is Your Wife first broadcast on the Fox network on March The live action opening had also become an Internet hit before it was aired in front of Homer Simpson This Is Your Wife and it was Groening s decision to use it Al Jean commented in a press statement that he was just amazed there are people who want to be known for looking like the Simpsons Christmas A Christmas themed version of the opening sequence was animated for the season episode Kill Gil Volumes I II which aired on December and later re aired with the season episode The Burns and the Bees which aired on December It begins with two lines of instrumental Jingle Bells Kill Gil Volumes I II and O Christmas Tree The Burns and the Bees and then the

couch boys I gave it to the poor and they cheer Guest made versions Some episodes have an opening sequence that was made by a special guest Banksy British graffiti artist and political activist Banksy is credited with creating the opening titles and couch gag for the season episode MoneyBart in what amounted to the first time that an artist has been invited to storyboard the show Jean first took note of Banksy after seeing his film Exit Through the Gift Shop According to Jean The concept in my mind was What if this graffiti artist came in and tagged our main titles Simpsons casting director Bonnie Pietila was able to contact the artist through the film s producers and asked if he would be interested in writing a main title for the show Jean said Banksy sent back boards for pretty much what you saw Series creator Matt Groening gave the idea his blessing and helped try to make the sequence as close to Banksy s original storyboards as possible Approximately the first half minute of the opening sequence remains the same with a few oddities the word BANKSY is sprayed onto a number of walls and other public spaces The chalkboard gag I must not write all over the walls is written all over the classroom walls clock door and floor After the Simpsons arrive at home the camera cuts to a shot of them on the couch then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional overseas Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray and the music turns dramatic la Schindler s List A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid Small kittens are thrown into a woodchipper type machine to provide the filling for Bart Simpson plush dolls The toys are then placed into a cart pulled by a sad panda which is driven by a man with a whip A man shipping boxes with The Simpsons logo on the side uses the tongue from a decapitated dolphin head to fasten shut the packages Another employee uses the horn of a sickly unicorn to smash the holes in the center of The Simpsons DVDs It is then revealed that the sweatshop is contained within a grim version of the th Century Fox logo surrounded by barbed wire searchlights and a watchtower The Simpsons is storyboarded at Film Roman a company based in California The storyboards voice tracks and coloring instructions are then sent to AKOM a company in Seoul South Korea According to Nelson Shin the founder of AKOM they received the storyboard for the sequence in August Believing the sequence to be excessive and offending he pushed for some of the darker jokes to be removed He was successful though not nearly as much as he had pushed for For example in the storyboards the workers were wearing conical Asian hats but these were removed Fox s standards and practices department also demanded a handful of changes but according to Jean percent of it is just the way Banksy wanted Banksy told The Guardian that his opening sequence was influenced by The Simpsons long running use of animation studios in Seoul South Korea The newspaper also reported that the creation of the sequence is said to have been one of the most closely guarded secrets in US television comparable to the concealment of Banksy s own identity Although conceding to the fact that The Simpsons is largely animated in South Korea Jean went on to state that the scenes shown in titles are very fanciful far fetched None of the things he depicts are true That statement should be self evident but I will emphatically state it John Kricfalusi After the positive response to the opening sequence by Banksy creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Canadian animator and creator of The Ren Stimpy Show John Kricfalusi and asked him if he could do something similar for the season episode Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts Originally they only wanted him to do the storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself explaining that If we had done it that way no one would even have known that I had anything to do with it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose On The Simpsons the animators draws key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses The interpolation however is a straight A to B animation That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose Kricfalusi explains that On the Simpsons I wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways not just looking funny each time they come to a stop and further elaborated that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work You can t write visual performance You have to actually draw it He showed Groening and showrunner Al Jean his Adult Swim shorts and Groening responded by giving him a free hand to do the second long segment Groening told him to break all The Simpsons rules but Kricfalusi explains that he tried not to break any rules in the characters personalities just in the execution of the visuals I didn t follow any models not even my own The more rules he broke the more pleased Groening and Jean were with the result Contrary to Banksy who lives a life in secrecy Kricfalusi was involved in every detail and even oversaw the dubbing of the final soundtrack While Kricfalusi animated the D parts he had John Kedzie to help him with the computer graphics and Sarah Harkey and Tommy Tanner to do the assistant animation The couch gag for the episode which had Homer demand a beer and Marge getting it for him was critically acclaimed by television critics Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew calls the opening revolutionary and explains that in short and sweet seconds he liberates the animation of The Simpsons from years of graphic banality He continued The visual look of the show which has been so carefully controlled by its producers becomes a giddy and unrestrained playground for graphic play and the balance of creative authority is shifted from the writers room to the animators in one fell swoop When comparing the segment to Banksy s Amidi concluded that it is in fact far more subversive because he focuses almost exclusively on making a pictorial statement relegating the show s dominant literary elements to the back seat Similarly Television Blend s Katey Rich wrote that she appreciates The Simpsons always being willing to push the envelope in different ways but admitted that it s gonna take her some time to get the gangly legged Marge Simpson and the leering Homer Simpson out of her brain Kricfalusi later animated the opening sequence for the season episode Treehouse of Horror XXVI where the Simpson children are trick or treating before being set upon by soul hungry spirits with a monstrous Frank Grimes among them that skins Bart for his soul before Maggie saves him and Lisa The spirits chase after the Simpson children to their home and the Frank Grimes monster takes Homer s soul Bill Plympton
