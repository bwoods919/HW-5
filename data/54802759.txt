him and they escape together in the administrator s helicopter after rigging the compound to explode Meanwhile the therapist Dr Wong is curious about Rick s absence despite Beth s attempts to shift

feelings Rick enters to get the syringe He admits lying to get out of therapy because he prefers to improve the world through science rather than feel better about it Wong responds that he uses his scientific intelligence to avoid the necessary work of self improvement On the way home Rick apologizes to Beth for lying then uses the syringe to turn back into a human Morty and Summer express interest in further therapy but Rick and Beth ignore them by mocking Wong and planning to go out drinking In a post credits scene the villain Concerto is preparing to kill a restrained Rick and Morty in his gigantic piano but Jaguar saves them Rick tells Morty that is why you don t go to therapy Production The episode was written by Jessica Gao Series creator Dan Harmon said that he thought the concept originated from a writer suggesting an episode beginning with Rick turning himself into a pickle They discussed his motivation and thought that he would do it because he could and to prove something to himself The therapy subplot was introduced so that the episode would keep addressing the divorce story of the season He also said that the Pickle Rick design is phallic and emblematic of self torture as Rick is his own worst enemy and does this transformation to himself Pickle Rick was one of Harmon s favorite episodes of the season He said that the episode took inspiration from the Breaking Bad episode Days Out where Walter White s van breaks down in the desert while he is cooking crystal meth with Jesse rather than being able to trick or negotiate with anyone White has to use his science knowledge to survive and restart the van Harmon thought it was interesting to see Rick in a situation with limited resources Writer Ryan Ridley said that the episode is not a spoof of anything in particular but it does make reference to the films Hours and Gravity During the writing process Harmon was undergoing a divorce and had entered therapy which influenced the episode he said of the speech Dr Wong gives to Rick I don t know if I could ve written that two years ago I would ve made sure Rick got the final word The character Dr Wong was named by Gao a Chinese writer who had found that unless a character is given a name with racial connotations the part will be cast as a white person Gao intended Wong to be played by an Asian actor Guest star Susan Sarandon was then discovered to be available and given the role of the therapist whose name was left unchanged Gao and Harmon discussed this topic in their podcast Whiting Wongs which is about diversity representation in television it took its name from this incident Character designer Kendra Melton estimated that Pickle Rick s rat suit underwent different design versions Maximus Pauson also a character designer stated that the one used was chosen so it emphasized the pickle ness Harmon commented that initial designs for the rats were too adorable considering that Rick murders many of them Melton said that fur was removed boils were added and their backs became more arched According to Harmon the writers gave more detailed instructions to animators than for most episodes in particular about the process of hacking the cockroach to give Rick mobility Release and merchandise At the San Diego Comic Con a rough cut animation of Pickle Rick was released featuring him in the sewer attacking rats As the second season of the show ended with Rick jailed this led some fans to believe that this was how he would escape leading to confusion when the third season premiere was released on April and showed Rick escaping in a very different way Three weeks prior to the episode s airing free Pickle Rick T shirts and other merchandise were given away at the San Diego Comic Con Due to the episode s hype prior to its release including fans getting tattoos of Pickle Rick Harmon was not surprised by its later popularity The episode first aired on Adult Swim at p m on August Afterward a number of merchandise products were released relating to the character Pickle Rick and the overall episode such as a game Funko Pop figures a Pringles flavor a Frosty drink a breakfast cereal and in game customization for Tom Clancy s Rainbow Six Siege The episode commentary on the Blu ray DVD was recorded by Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D B Weiss and Peter Dinklage who played Tyrion Lannister in the series The comic Rick and Morty Presents The Vindicators features an alternate Pickle Rick as a member of the titular team Rick and Morty Presents Pickle Rick depicts an alternate version of the events of the episode as a long commercial for Thunderous Squirt Xtreme starring the character Mr Poopybutthole Rick and Morty Presents Jaguar follows the character Jaguar as he reunites with his family Analysis Unlike the previous two episodes in the season Pickle Rick is set entirely on Earth but like those episodes it explores Beth and Jerry s divorce This marks a change for the show which previously had little storyline continuity Jenny Jaffe of Vulture described the episode as an instance of how Rick and Morty likes to back itself into corners with the world s dumbest ideas and execute them in the absolute smartest ways A number of reviewers commented on the violence for instance Jesse Schedeen of IGN said that it contained a level of blood and gore matching the season two episode Look Who s Purging Now IndieWire s Steve Greene stated that the episode reached some new levels of grotesquery even compared to the violence of Rick s car while protecting Summer in The Ricks Must Be Crazy Jack Shepherd of The Independent wrote that the episode parodies s action films in the storyline with Russian mobsters and their English leader and Schedeen believed that it parodies hyper violent action films and the John Wick film series Joe Matar of Den of Geek commented that the episode emulates the action film Die Hard as Harmon did previously in the Community episode Modern Warfare The compound in which Pickle Rick finds himself was the subject of discussion among reviewers Schedeen referred to it as a Russian embassy while Shepherd called it an unnamed high secure facility filled with Russian mobsters and Greene described it as apparently a shadowy Eastern European financial consortium Zack Handlen of The A V Club wrote I don t think the country of the embassy is ever specifically established which is part of the joke though noted that the bodyguards are European A Nerdist article connected the scene where Rick controls the movement of the cockroach by poking its brain with his tongue to a study Central Complex Control of Movement in the Freely Walking Cockroach published in Current Biology where researchers were able to stimulate neurons of a cockroach in order to control its movement Characterization Critics commented that Summer and Morty were interested in therapy while Beth and Rick were not Jaffe wrote that Beth s children seem much more affected by the therapist s concerns than Beth and Rick Matar agreed stating that Morty and Summer both hope they ll get to go back to therapy but Beth and Rick have chosen to act above it all Zach Blumenfeld of Paste wrote about the car scene that the eyes of Morty and Summer lock into a thousand yard stare as their mom and grandpa totally ignore the kids needs He believed that discussion between Beth and Rick shows more clearly than ever their seemingly hereditary penchant for self destructive narcissism and noted that Jerry s wet blanket but well meaning personality had a stabilizing effect on Beth and the family Reviewers also analyzed Beth s relationship with her father Jess Joho of Mashable opined that Beth has a father or Electra complex saying that the episode takes Freudian symbolism into the literal and the choice of a pickle is a literal phallic symbol Jaffe stated that Beth doesn t want to believe that Rick is choosing to skip therapy as it is so important to her Shepherd found that Beth has unresolved abandonment issues and that mental agony is causing her some serious inner stress that comes out in snarky attacks on everyone around her Shepherd opined that Rick shows he cares for the family by turning up to therapy Handlen wrote that Rick s choice to live with the Smith family implies he does recognize a basic need for those relationships and that he avoids therapy because he s smart enough to know that Dr Wong is right Schedeen said that Dr Wong s speech really cut to the core of his selfish narcissistic behavior giving Rick one of his rare moments of clarity However he believed that Beth will forgive anything he does so long as he continues being a father figure Joho argued that in his diatribe against therapy Rick finally shows his true colors to everyone in the room He called Dr Wong s speech a succinct takedown of toxic masculinity Reception The episode s premiere on Adult Swim was watched by million viewers Several critics commented on the fan enthusiasm such as Blumenfeld who said it was arguably the most eagerly anticipated Rick and Morty episode ever due to the large amount of teaser content released In June Julia Alexander of Polygon argued that Pickle Rick is already everyone s favorite character from Rick and Morty s third season citing fan actions such as creating Twitter and Tumblr accounts for the character Alexander commented that the show has found a dedicated fan base because of the absurdity it bases its comedy in In a United States Air Force aircraft used a call sign in reference to the episode The episode was critically acclaimed receiving ratings of five out of five in Vulture out of five in Den of Geek out of in IGN and out of in Paste The A V Club rated it an A and IndieWire gave it a B Schedeen praised it as the show at its most entertaining and Greene praised it as one of the series best examples of untethering Rick Sanchez from all laws of nature and physics and marveling at the results Jaffe described it as a Freudian acid trip that is surreal and self aware Matar found it super engaging lauding the charmingly stupid concept that develops into an absurdly overblown kinetic action movie plot The animation of Pickle Rick and his storyline received acclaim Matar believed that the animation was easily the coolest aspect of the episode Shepherd found a pickle to be the ideal food that s both hilarious and very very Rick Scott Russell of Paste reviewed that the batshit fight scenes were the best part of the episode with Blumenfeld also enjoying the beautiful free flowing sequences of mass murder Handlen praised the pacing saying that the episode doesn t belabor the point Greene highlighted the attention to detail such as the sound design of Pickle Rick s mustard salve soothing his laser burns which gave a strange amount of credence to a crazy premise Danny Trejo received praise in his role as Jaguar Blumenfeld said that he shines in the role and Schedeen wrote that the episode made great use of him Shepherd called him a highlight of the episode particularly in his dialogue This ends when one of us dies and I ve never died before However Blumenfeld said that the program is better when characters describe their feelings in short bursts and criticized Rick s speech to Jaguar as something the show would earlier have mercilessly mocked The therapy storyline also garnered praise with Russell calling it perhaps the strongest B plot of the season Handlen praised the jokes involving Dr Wong working with coprophagia addicts Blumenfeld approved of the strong emotional punch of the ending and Matar enjoyed the slow pace of the ending scenes as a nice breather after all the madcap nonsense that came before Schedeen praised Sarandon for making a strong impression as the surprisingly perceptive Dr Wong Greene said that a certain thread of magic is removed from separating Rick from Morty but that the episode s genre riffing and intense commitment to detail nearly make up for it Accolades In September Rick and Morty received its first Emmy with a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program for Pickle Rick The episode also won an Annie Award and was nominated for a Golden Reel Award References External links Pickle Rick at IMDb
