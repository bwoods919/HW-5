written by J Torres and illustrated by CJ Cannon The front cover was designed by Jen Bartel Additionally Oni Press published Origin of the Vindicators Vindicators on November Analysis The episode satirizes superhero movies Steve Greene of IndieWire wrote that the superheroes are not a direct parody of one specific superhero team though Hannah Mylrea of NME compared Vance to Star Lord and Supernova to Teen Titans Starfire Jack Shepherd of The Independent and Greene found Noob Noob similar to season Total Rickall character Mr Poopybutthole Greene found the reference to the lack of diversity amongst the Vindicators after the previous deaths of superheroes of color similar to a reference in the previous episode Pickle Rick to Dr Wong being a poor choice of name for a character voiced by the non Asian Susan Sarandon Previous episodes have also positioned Rick as a villain with the season premiere The Rickshank Rickdemption also demonstrating a growing friction between Rick and Morty and a maturity in Morty It continues a theme in season of exploring Sanchez family dynamics and of featuring a bleaker tone Unlike many other episodes Vindicators does not feature a B story Reception The episode first aired on Adult Swim at p m on August where it was watched by million viewers Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the episode out of praising the fun twists and the humorous dynamic between sober Rick and drunk Rick Schedeen praised that the ending subverted a past pattern of Rick showing genuine affection whilst drunk With a B rating Greene found the episode entertaining in parts though thinking that it was too similar to season s Anatomy Park He praised the Vindicator guest stars approving of the nice bit of misdirection in Slater s character being killed first Shepherd found the episode one of their funniest most deranged adventures yet praising its use of superhero tropes Spin off series On May Adult Swim announced a short prequel spin off series entitled The Vindicators was in development alongside spin offs from other Adult Swim shows like Aqua Teen Hunger Force Robot Chicken and Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell The ten episode series was released on YouTube on July titled The Vindicators Each episode is between two and three minutes long The series centers on the characters Supernova Vance Maxiumus Alan Rails Crocubot and Noob Noob loosely adapting the events of Origin of the Vindicators Vindicators and Vindicators It was written by Sarah Carbiener and Erica Rosbe who told i that the short format allowed them to explore non standard plots and slice of life depictions of superheroes Production took place over the videoconferencing software Zoom The main voice actors from the episode reprise their roles The shorts depict the Vindicators second adventure such as how Supernova destroyed the populated planet of Dorian after having a miscarriage with Million Ants children and mistakenly killed three of the other teammates Lady Katana Calypso and Diablo Verde after she got blackout drunk It shows how Rick killed the planet eating Doom Nomitron with a satellite that had a set it and forget it trap though the Vindicators take credit for saving the galaxy Writing for Film Rafael Motamayor reviewed that the series is far from groundbreaking or even that surprising and due to the length each episode mostly amounts to a single visual joke However Motamayor found it a fun and harmless way to revisit these characters make fun superhero stories and expand on the implications of the heroes wild powers References External
