season has an approval rating of from Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews and an average rating of out of with the site s consensus Rick and Morty dives into new and even kookier cosmic dilemmas in a third season that interrogates familial bonds love and nihilism treating all existential topics to the series trademark serrated wit Zack Handlen of The A V Club praised the episode s uniqueness and the fact that it does not follow a single linear plot like the season premiere The Rickshank Rickdemption however the review also noted that the show was writing itself into a corner Jesse Schedeen of IGN called the episode a deep dive into all the horrible adventures Morty would just as soon and did forget The results were amusing but this episode still lacked the freshness of Rixty Minutes The review comparing the episode to the season two episode Interdimensional Cable Tempting Fate also said it is more entertaining than another Interdimensional Cable sequel likely would have been but it s far from the strongest installment of the season Nor is it a formula that demands its own sequel Inverse called the episode an entertaining alternate to Interdimensional Cable that s a lot more fun than the random madness of alternate reality television but these stories actually have an impact on how we perceive the show s main characters also posing the theory that the episode is set in an alternate universe from the rest of the show with an alternate version of Rick and Morty as the episode implies that the two characters have migrated to a new dimension more than shown in previous episodes Den of Geek also compared and contrasted the episode to Interdimensional Cable saying each sketch can t start with a completely blank canvas Rick and Morty have to be at the center of all of them which like the lack of ad libbing makes this a lot less of a freewheeling ride and giving the episode overall stars out of In an episode review Steve Greene of IndieWire said For a series that delights in its visual inventiveness it s hard to believe that this was the first time Rick and Morty ventured into the M C Escher zone barely escaping a logic puzzle architectural trap with their bodies and minds intact References
