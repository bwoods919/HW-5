dilemmas in a third season that interrogates familial bonds love and nihilism treating all existential topics to the series trademark serrated wit IGN commented on the fact that Beth and Jerry usually don t play a starring role in given season episodes saying The ABCs of Beth felt like a concerted effort to make up for lost time and it didn t disappoint Jesse Schedeen the writer of the review also said the episode contained Some pretty dark stuff in other words It s enough to wonder if the writers went a little too far exploring the dark creature that lurks beneath Beth s pleasant exterior Den of Geek called the entire season especially The ABC s of Beth overstuffed saying that it loses the plot a little It s unfortunate because this series has been so good about gradually fleshing out all its characters beyond Rick and Morty and this was Beth s time to shine Writer Joe Matar of Den of Geek gave the episode three out of five stars Jenny Jaffe of Vulture said that If the fact that The ABCs of Beth comes right after Morty s Mind Blowers is at all significant we might conclude that they ve done all of this before and they ll continue to do this again in every conceivable universe until the end of time But as Rick or Beth might remind us it doesn t really matter Nothing does References
