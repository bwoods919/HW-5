Fortnite Battle Royale is a free to play battle royale video game developed and published by Epic Games It is a companion game to Fortnite Save the World a cooperative survival game with construction elements It was initially released in early access on September for macOS PlayStation Windows and Xbox One followed by ports for iOS Nintendo Switch and Android The following year Epic dropped the early access label for the game on June Versions for the Xbox Series X S and PlayStation were released as launch titles in late The concept of the game is similar to previous games of the genre players skydive onto an island and scavenge for gear to defend themselves from other players Players can fight alone or with up to four other players As the match progresses the playable area within the island gradually constricts giving the players less and less room to work with outside this safe zone is the Storm which inflicts damage on those caught inside it with the amount of damage growing as the Storm itself does The last player or team alive wins the match The main distinction from others in the genre is the game s construction elements letting players build walls obstacles and other structures from collected resources to take cover from incoming fire or give one a strategic view advantage Battle Royale uses a seasonal approach with battle passes to introduce new character customization content in the game as well as limited time events some of which correspond with changes to the game map Since its initial release several other game modes have been introduced including Battle Lab and Party Royale The idea for Battle Royale arose following the release of PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds in a similar battle royale game that was highly successful but noted for its technical flaws Originally released as part of the early access version of Save the World Epic later transitioned the game to a free to play model funded by microtransactions Following its rise in popularity Epic split the development team with one focusing on Battle Royale and the other on Save the World Battle Royale received positive reviews from critics who praised its learning curve gameplay art style multiplayer and progression system while receiving criticism regarding parental and security concerns The game quickly rose in popularity following its release eventually surpassing Battlegrounds in overall player count and revenue Player count had exceeded million by May The game has gone on to become a cultural phenomenon with promotion through social media and several celebrities such as Ninja Marshmello and Drake contributing to the game s popularity achieving record high viewership on streaming platforms in the process Gameplay The main gameplay for Fortnite Battle Royale follows the standard format for the battle royale genre The game normally is played either with each player on their own or in a squad of two to four players with up to players participating each round The round starts with players weaponless skydiving from floating buses Battle Bus then deploying a glider onto a region of land The island s fixed layout includes several landmarks and locations named in an alliterative fashion such as Lazy Lake Pleasant Park and Retail Row that are mostly ghost towns during matches while a random distribution of weapons shields and other combat support features can be found by searching chests scattered in buildings and other sites The primary goal is to be the last player or team alive by eliminating or avoiding other players When playing in solo modes players are immediately eliminated when they exhaust their health In squad modes downed players can crawl around while losing health they can be eliminated immediately by an opponent or revived by a squadmate to help them up Initially when the game launched eliminated players were out of the match but starting with updates in April squadmates can attempt to respawn a downed player at various Reboot vans scattered around the map which are few and far between and in the open making it a risk to respawn a squadmate Over time the game s safe zone representing the eye of a storm decreases in size and players caught outside the zone will take damage This directs the surviving players into tighter spaces forcing player encounters Supply drops will spawn in random locations during a match providing random weapons and items Like in the original Fortnite game Fortnite Battle Royale is primarily played in a third person perspective Fortnite Battle Royale s primary distinction from other battle royale games is the building system which originated from the original Fortnite survival game Nearly all objects in the environment can be destroyed and harvested for materials wood stone and metal which can then be used to build fortifications of limited durabilities such as walls ramps floors and roofs which can be used to help traverse the map protect the player from gunfire or slow down progression of other players Weaker pieces can be destroyed in a few hits but can be built quickly while stronger pieces can withstand more damage but take longer to build A special Zero Build game mode was introduced in March which eliminated all building aspects in the Battle Royale mode and became a permanent secondary mode in the game by April The game is free to play supported by microtransactions that allow players to buy V Bucks the game s internal currency V Bucks are also shared with the main Fortnite Save the World game which offers players the opportunity to earn V Bucks by completing missions or daily quests V Bucks can then be used to buy cosmetic improvements to the player outfits pickaxes gliders backblings and emotes The game is run in chapters with a number of seasons each season lasting about weeks each Each season introduces an exclusive set of cosmetic items that can be obtained These are offered through a dual track battle pass which features a number of tiers that players climb through by earning experience through completing in game objectives while acquiring cosmetic rewards or other items in the process Each player has access to the free track of the Battle Pass which offers fewer cosmetics that can be earned by clearing multiple tiers while players can also purchase the Pass premium track with V Bucks which offers more challenges and grants prizes for every tier the player advances Players can use V Bucks to purchase tiers as well once they have bought the Battle Pass Starting in December Epic added the Fortnite Crew monthly subscription plan those on the plan gain access to the latest Battle Pass a monthly allocation of V Bucks and access to exclusive cosmetics only available to subscribers Since release Epic Games has added more features such as new weapon and items and makeshift vehicles such as shopping carts and golf carts Epic is also able to deploy hotfixes to the game to adjust aspects like weapon attributes and distribution pushing these out in minutes if necessary should they or players discover critical issues or glitches as well as removing older or not well received items from the game in a process called vaulting With the release of the standalone Fortnite Creative gameplay mode in December an area of the Fortnite Battle Royale map called The Block featured a rotating selection of user made creations developed in Creative mode and approved by Epic A Battle Lab mode was added in December for players to create their own custom battle royale games In April a new Party Royale mode was added taking place on a small map where combat and construction was disabled though non lethal gameplay items can be acquired like paint guns and vehicles this map was aimed to be used as a social space as well as to host in game events like concerts Prior to September Fortnite did not have specialized matchmaking outside of platform and regional limits With an upcoming patch the game introduced skill based matchmaking based on internal metrics that judge a player s skill in the game Further with Chapter Season the game will add special matches against computer controlled bots to help players practice the game Limited time and competitive modes Epic has the ability to include limited time modes LTM within the game which provides Epic with experimental capabilities and gain feedback from players to improve upon One of its earliest additions was a v mode placing players randomly on one of two teams and dropping them on opposite sides of the map giving the two teams time to gather resources create fortifications and hunt the other team before the storm moved in A sandbox Playground LTM was introduced in June which allows up to four players to explore and build anything anywhere on the battle map while being able to fight each other and respawn upon defeat until the storm covered the map after an hour and eliminated them all Epic later made this a permanent mode in the game Epic has stated that they intend to add ranked competitive play in the future A preliminary competitive mode Solo Showdown ran for a limited time starting in May ranking players by their final placement in matches and rewarding the top placing competitors with V Bucks Epics newest addition to the game starting out Chapter Season was a temporary change called No Building This change removed all building mechanics in game In exchange Epic added Over Shield giving each player shield to start off with that would recharge throughout the game Epic later turned this change into its own game mode that would bring the building game mode back Fortnite released a new game mode called Zero Build on March This game mode initially started out as a temporary change in Chapter Season to the main Battle Royale game mode This change removed building completely not allowing any option for a Building Game mode Epic decided to then make this its own game mode due to its popularity Epic brought back building on April allowing for the option of either Building or Zero Building choice of gameplay This game mode features no building mechanics making it less competitive to its successor Epic added additional Overshield when you start off giving you the capacity of health shield total to help supplement the change in game play On April Fortnite released the Zero Build Trials Signing up for this and completing the challenges would allow players to be rewarded with in game rewards On July Epic released the first Zero Build Arena mode a limited time game mode lasting until August This game was initially released in Trios gameplay only allowing you to have a total of teammates The Loot in the Arena mode is identical to the loot found in the Zero Build Mode Seasonal changes Fortnite Battle Royale has created a larger loose narrative that is exhibited through changes in the game map which generally correlated to the start and end of the in game season For example in the lead up to the fourth season of the first chapter which started in May players saw a number of shooting stars cross the skies followed by a giant comet that neared the ground upon the start of that season the comet had hit one of the locations on the map leaving a giant crater among other changes This tied into several new cosmetic skins related to superheroes and super villains that were available that month Epic has the ability to create custom events that occur across all game servers simultaneously as well the first example of such was a countdown leading to a giant rocket s launch in June which in the aftermath left cracks in the skies that have grown since that event The game initially launched without any seasonable schedule but starting with the release of Chapter Season in December Epic has provided new content which includes new cosmetics new gameplay elements and changes to the game s map on a roughly week basis This also introduced the use of the battle pass for players to obtain some of this new content by completing challenges and gaining experience Chapter Chapter Chapter Chapter Promotional modes and elements Shortly after the release of the film Avengers Infinity War Epic ran a Marvel sponsored event that featured the Infinity Gauntlet that randomly spawned on the map any player that equipped it became Thanos with added abilities A second Avengers based mode was released upon the release of Avengers Endgame where players are randomly split between Avenger and Chitauri armies seeking out the Infinity Stones or the Infinity Gauntlet Since then other promotional content from other commercial properties including cosmetic items and map features has been available for limited periods in Fortnite typically around the time of premieres or first broadcasts for these works These commercial properties have included Ralph Breaks the Internet John Wick Stranger Things Star Wars Birds of Prey The Matrix Cobra Kai among several others Non gameplay related promotional events have included EDM artist Marshmello held a virtual concert in the Pleasant Park location on February across all game servers estimated to have had over million players watching it live On December a special preview of Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker was released at the Risky Reels location hosted by Geoff Keighley which also featured the character of Emperor Palpatine in a voice segment that was referred to in the film s opening crawl Travis Scott performed a virtual Astronomical tour in support of his album Astroworld within Fortnite on multiple live concerts between April and including the premiere of a new song The Scotts featuring Kid Cudi The first performance on April was estimated to have drawn over million players to watch while a total of million unique viewers cumulatively watched the concerts Along with these concerts the event included a new cosmetics based on Scott for in game purchase Scott also Fortnite inspired Cactus Jack products such as action figures and lunchboxes for the event Diplo performed a live Major Lazer concert along with Jordan Fisher in the new Party Royale game mode on May while a multi part concert by Dillon Francis Steve Aoki and Deadmau was held on May to celebrate the full release of the Party Royale game mode A trailer for Christopher Nolan s Tenet was first shown in the Party Royale game mode before releasing to other digital services on May In June Fortnite announced that it would livestream three Nolan films Inception Batman Begins and The Prestige depending on the region through its Movie Nite event within Party Royale Epic Games partnered with Nolan and Warner Bros to secure distribution rights in different languages and countries BTS premiered their dance choreography music video for Dynamite in the Party Royale game mode on September J Balvin performed a live concert in the Party Royale game mode on October premiering a new song titled La Luz Anyone who attended the concert could get a special J Balvin style for the Party Trooper outfit The concert was recorded using extended reality XR technology Epic launched a short animated film festival within the Party Royale mode in February called Short Nite Ariana Grande performed virtually as the headline act of the Rift Tour in August The Kid Laroi performed virtually at his concert Wild Dreams in January Epic started a regular Fortnite Spotlight in game concert event series in September using the Party Royale game mode with such concerts from various musicians planned on a weekly basis and free for any player of Fortnite to watch The musician will perform their set in a special studio set up by Epic that will be digitized in game According to Nate Nanzer Epic Games head of global partnerships We re creating this platform to work with artists big artists and up and coming artists Development Fortnite had first been revealed by Epic Games in considered to be a combination of Minecraft and Left Dead as four players would work together to scavenge resources to build fortifications traps weapons and other objects to survive monster attacks The game ended up with a protracted development period in part due to both external pressures with the industry transitioning to a games as a service model and internal shifts of focus within Epic including focusing attention on their first free to play title Paragon to meet the external challenges During this period Epic made a deal with Tencent giving them about of the company in exchange for their support for the games as a service approach as well as ready access to the Chinese video game market Fortnite was confirmed to have a planned release in June with a paid early access period starting a month later the game is planned otherwise as a free to play title supported by microtransactions With release in early access the game featured its primary gameplay mode Save the World where players in teams up to four would work cooperatively to survive and complete objectives on randomly generated maps During the latter part of Fortnite s development PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds was released in March on personal computers in early access and quickly became a popular and successful game becoming the defining example of the battle royale genre According to Mustard the Epic team loved Battle Royale games like Battlegrounds and explored how they could make a similar mode within Fortnite s engine They kept this mode in a separate development team from the main player versus environment modes for experimentation and as to not throw off the balance in the main game The Battle Royale mode development was led by Eric Williamson with Zack Estep as production lead Their goal was to develop the Battle Royale mode quickly from the core Save the World mode putting off any complex features that weren t already in place as to launch the new mode as soon as possible while they explored such potential ideas they held off inclusion until after the main mode was launched The development of the Battle Royale mode took about two months starting in July after the Save the World mode had shipped and was aided by the Unreal Tournament team Key differences for Battle Royale that differed from Save the World included a more limited progression for weapons a small subset of traps and a smoother more natural terrain for the maps They also wanted to aim for games not taking longer than minutes which led to some decisions of which elements from Save the World would not carry over They had included Fortnite s building mechanic for fortifications not sure how players would use that since the safe zone would continue shrinking but found quickly that the mechanic helped to distinguish the game from Battlegrounds and was used by expert players frequently to win matches and had since implemented more features to help players with rapidly constructing temporary bases In those two months of development Epic s plan was to include Battle Royale within the paid Fortnite game and originally announced this approach publicly in early September Only two weeks before it was released did Epic decide to make it a separate free to play title fearing that having it as part of the paid package would slow down the growth of the title Epic announced this change formally about a week after first announcing Battle Royale allowing those that had purchased early access to Fortnite in anticipation of this mode to request refunds This release which beat out Battlegrounds to consoles caused some concern with Battlegrounds developer Bluehole as they had been working closely with Epic for Unreal engine support in Battlegrounds and were worried that Fortnite might be able to include planned features to their Battle Royale mode before they could release those in Battlegrounds With the popularity of Fortnite Battle Royale by the start of Epic split off a separate development team to focus on improvements for this mode Epic said that their attention to Fortnite was causing some of their other games to see lower player populations leading them to reduce development efforts on these games particularly Paragon By the end of January Epic announced it was shutting down Paragon by April of that year providing refunds to all players Similarly Epic announced it had halted development of the planned free to play Unreal Tournament game its team transitioned to Fortnite though the game will remain available playable and open to end user modifications Players on a Fortnite dedicated Reddit forum had expressed concerns that a similar fate could befall the Save the World mode of Fortnite as externally the Save the World mode has not received the same attention in providing updates and improvements compared to the Battle Royale mode since that mode s release According to Mustard from the start of developing Fortnite Battle Royale Epic had been interested in telling a narrative with the game with a long term narrative planned out by Mustard but recognized the challenge when most players were focused on the base mechanics of the title They decided to make players more as witnesses to the events rather than central characters allowing the story to be told out through non player characters that the players may encounter or through the game s additional media This long term narrative was designed to be flexible accounting for both responses from players as well as for cross promotions that Epic had secured over time which had connected to the overall concept of a multiverse that is part of this narrative Incorporating the narrative elements had led the development team to plan out new ways to include them such as the single time events across all servers or specialized single player missions On June Epic announced that they considered Save the World to no longer be in early access and as a companion move eliminated the early access labels from both Battle Royale and Creative modes With the launch of Chapter on December Epic brought the game to use Unreal Engine Localization Tencent who is a partial owner of Epic Games brought Fortnite Battle Royale to China in the company was already involved in supporting Battlegrounds in China as well Tencent planned to spend up to US million to help promote the game in China set up eSports tournaments and fight against copyright infringement and clones of Fortnite that have appeared in the country Epic also worked with Neowiz Games to bring a version of Fortnite to South Korea launched in November Tencent announced in October that the Chinese version of Fortnite which had never left the beta phase and had a number of functional differences from international versions of the game would be shutting down on November disallowing new user registration This move came after new regulations and restrictions made by the Chinese government towards online gaming Ports A release of Fortnite for the Nintendo Switch video game console had been rumored in the week prior to the E in June During the Nintendo Direct presentation Nintendo and Epic Games announced the release of Fortnite Battle Royale for the Nintendo Switch supporting cross platform play with any other platform except the PlayStation such users are able to carry over their inventory Battle Pass status and in game currency between these platforms through their Epic user account The game was released on June the same day as the announcement It is the first game to support direct voice chat through the Switch console through software provided by Vivox With the success of the Switch version of Fortnite Vivox had made its voice chat software development kit available for other Switch games In March Epic announced it was making Fortnite Battle Royale for Android and iOS mobile devices The iOS version was released first and was expected to be followed by the Android version by mid The beta version for iOS devices launched on March and opened to all players on April Epic Games stated that it was not possible to release the Android version with the iOS version simultaneously and declined to provide a concrete release date for it because the developers wanted to spend a few months making sure that the game will be compatible with as many Android devices as possible a task that is not easily accomplished due to the high variety of Android hardware The Android beta version of Fortnite was released on August with a time exclusivity for selected Samsung mobile devices until August On August Epic began sending invites for the Android version to registered users for non Samsung devices and by October the Android client was made available to all without an invite Until April the Android version was originally not distributed on Google Play Store users had to sideload an installer app from an Android application package APK file downloaded from the Epic Games website although on Samsung devices the app was also available via the internal Samsung Galaxy Apps service Epic Games stated that it wanted to have a direct connection to the players of the game and did not want its microtransactions to be subject to Google Play Store s revenue sharing requirement considering them disproportionate to the types of services the store provides Epic had tried to seek an exemption from Google from this revenue cut for in app purchases but Google refused stating the need for the fee to maintain and improve the Google Play storefront Security experts expressed concern over this decision since this requires users to modify security settings in default Android distributions to allow third party sites to install Android application packages APK This setting can make users particularly younger players prone to potential malware including clones of Fortnite that install malicious programming About a month after the Android release there were at least clones of the Fortnite installer on the Google Store with half found to include malware Epic s installer for Android does include a warning message following the install that users should re enable security controls and warns users of only downloading content from trusted sources The initial installer was found by Google to have a potential vector that would allow for malware to be installed though this was patched within hours of discovery and Epic did not believe anyone used the vector By April Epic announced it would release Fortnite for Android via the Play Store and discontinue its side loading approach stating that Google puts third party software outside of the Play Store at a high disadvantage The iOS version of Fortnite Battle Royale alone brought in an estimated US million in microtransaction revenue within the first three days of in app purchases being available according to analysis firm Sensor Tower Glixel considered these numbers impressive compared to the early success rate of other popular mobile games such as Pok mon Go and Clash Royale which earned US million and US million in their first four days respectively Sensor Tower further estimated that after one month the mobile title had earned more than US million in revenue surpassing revenues from any other mobile games and other several top grossing apps during the same period Epic announced in May alongside its reveal of the upcoming Unreal Engine that ports of Fortnite for the PlayStation and Xbox Series X are planned to be available at the time of consoles releases in late These will initially run on Unreal Engine but the game is expected to transition to Unreal Engine by mid when the engine is released Fortnite finally moved to Unreal Engine with the launch of Chapter in December Cross platform play For the first five seasons all ports of Fortnite Battle Royale supported cross platform play with other versions but with limited interaction in regards to the PlayStation Players on personal computer and mobile versions could cross play with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users or alternatively they could cross play with PlayStation users While Epic Games had expressed interest in having full cross platform play across all available platforms Sony s continued refusal to allow cross play between the PlayStation and other consoles rendered this impossible according to Microsoft Further while players could use a single Epic Games account to share progress in Fortnite Battle Royale on all other platforms those who used their PlayStation Network credentials to establish their Epic account cannot use that account on other platforms The account restriction was confirmed to be as a result of Sony s initial decision to prohibit cross platform play between its PlayStation and other consoles rather than a choice Epic had made By September Sony had made a decision to allow cross platform play for the PlayStation for select third party titles starting with Fortnite A beta version of the PlayStation client supporting this was released for the game on September the same day as Sony s announcement Tools to merge multiple Epic accounts as well as unlinking console accounts from an Epic account to attach to another were released in February The first full patch adding in cross platform play support across all consoles was released in March Solo mobile players or squads entirely consisting of mobile players will play solely with other mobile players by default for fairness players however can use cross platform play to join squads on other platforms and matchmaking will consider all available matches With the March for cross platform play the game will similar matchmake PlayStation and Xbox One users by default to avoid these players being at a disadvantage against computer users Promotion and marketing In May Epic announced a partnership with sports apparel manufacturing company IMG to produce official Fortnite themed clothing A Hasbro licensed Fortnite Battle Royale themed version of Monopoly was announced for release by late the Fortnite Monopoly game reflects some elements of the video game such as the money being replaced with player s lives and the ability to protect properties on the board with walls Further with this deal Hasbro produced Fortnite based Nerf blasters which reached retail in Funko released a series of Fortnite themed Pop figurines in late Fortnite Battle Royale has been packaged as special bundles with both the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch each version providing redeemable codes for V bucks and platform unique customization options A retail release of Fortnite Battle Royale called Fortnite Deep Freeze Bundle was distributed by Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in late The package included a redeemable code for V Bucks and unique in game cosmetics In October Epic launched its Support a Creator program for Fortnite Individual players could designate one of several popular Fortnite streamers selected by Epic via an application process to support via the game client That creator would then earn money based on how many V bucks their supporters spent within the game at a rate of US for every V Bucks roughly of the monetary value Though initially planned as a limited time event Epic found by December that millions of Fortnite players were using the promotion to support more than streamers and since have made it a permanent option for Fortnite and hoping this would help some creators go full time and plans to extend this program to other games offered via the Epic Games Store including Tom Clancy s The Division In November Epic partnered with the National Football League NFL to make character skins for each of the teams in the league available to purchase for a limited time This was the result of the influence of Fortnite on NFL players who had frequently performed Fortnite dance emotes as touchdown celebrations Esports One of the first professional esports competitions using Fortnite was the Fortnite Pro Am event held on June during E with in attendance This tournament was announced after the success of the March stream by Ninja where he played alongside celebrities like

issues with game servers while the second event ended with accusations of cheating towards the winner which Epic later verified were not true Epic launched its second competition play series the Fall Skirmish on September with up to US million in prizes for winners Starting with the game s tenth season in August Epic plans to run various Champion Series competitions for cash prizes Each series is

worldwide Individual platform releases saw initial surges in player counts Within a day of becoming available the Nintendo Switch version had been downloaded over million times according to Nintendo Epic said that Fortnite had been downloaded over million times for Android within three weeks of its launch On the release of Season in July Akamai Technologies reported that Fortnite traffic neared terabytes per second the largest recorded amount of traffic for any video game that they have observed With its quarterly financial report ending September Nintendo said that Fortnite Battle Royale had been downloaded on about half of all Switch systems they have sold representing about million downloads Fortnite Battle Royale was made available to South Korea and their numerous PC bangs in November shortly after this point Epic reported that Fortnite has surpassed a concurrent player count of million surpassing the game s previous record of million in February Analysis firm SuperData

valuation Because of Fortnite Battle Royale Epic s valuation increased to US billion as of May Bloomberg raised the estimate to around US billion by the end of should Fortnite Battle Royale reach US billion during the year Partially due to the influx of revenue from Fortnite Battle Royale Epic reduced its portion of sales it collected from the Unreal Engine Marketplace from to in July applying that retroactively to past sales Viewership Fortnite Battle Royale has also had record viewership on various streaming services One of the first major streams of Fortnite was in March in which Tyler Ninja Blevins hosted a stream that included Drake Travis Scott Kim DotCom and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith Schuster all playing the game The stream broke over concurrent viewers making

besides being free to play and available on consoles the game was released at a time when Battlegrounds was struggling with game cheaters and a toxic community and that it features a less violent cartoonish quality to it that like Minecraft was able to draw in a younger and mixed gendered audiences to play Further Epic has maintained frequent updates for the game adding new weapons and in game tools alongside limited time events and longer term narrative elements that help to further draw in players The high interest in the game within March which has been able to draw larger audiences compared to existing multiplayer games like Grand Theft Auto Online and Destiny has had a financial impact on competing publishers Take Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard their stocks having fallen during this period according to analysts from Morgan Stanley and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Activision s CEO Bobby Kotick on their quarterly results released May stated that Fortnite is definitely a lot of competition right now it s been a really important catalyst in attracting new gamers to gaming and the company is looking to develop its own battle royale title Electronic Arts CEO Blake Jorgensen also considered both Fortnite Battle Royale and Battlegrounds as having a significant market impact Jorgensen said Fortnite is bringing younger people into the marketplace and younger people into first person shooters and I think that s good for the long run health of that category for all of us in the industry Non video game entertainment companies have also seen the impact of Fortnite Netflix in reporting its Q results stated that their competition is more with Fortnite including streaming content related to the game rather than rival television network stations like HBO

village inhabited by Asgardian refugees recuperating from the devastating events of Thor Ragnarok and Avengers Infinity War Past and ongoing concerns Parental concerns With the release of the mobile version teachers parents and students have found that the game had become popular to younger players due to the free to play nature its cartoonish art style and its social nature This carries over into educational institutions where the game has been seen as a disruptive element within the classroom and affecting students ability to complete homework assignments Epic has since added warnings on the game s loading screens to discourage students from playing it during classes The UK s Secretary of State for Digital Culture Media and Sport at the time Matt Hancock expressed concern at how much time children were playing Fortnite Battle Royale and similar video games without a balance of physical exercise and social interactions Other agencies including the United States Center on Media and Child Health and the United Kingdom s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children have cautioned parents that children may be influenced by the violent behavior due to Fortnite Battle Royale Prince Harry speaking about various influences of social media on children in April proposed a possible ban on Fortnite Battle Royale saying The game shouldn t be allowed and It s created to addict An addiction to keep you in front of a computer for as long as possible It s so irresponsible Calex Legal a Montreal law firm filed a class action lawsuit against Epic Games asserting that Epic has known the game is addictive but fail to give this warning to players Calex s suit was allowed to proceed in December after both a Superior Court and the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the lawsuit was not frivolous A separate class action suit filed in California in February asserts that Epic knowingly misleads and manipulates minors into handing over ever increasing amounts of real money for virtual things through its V bucks system At the same time parents have expressed appreciation for Fortnite to have their children engage socially outside of their core groups of friends in a game that is otherwise not excessively violent or see offering Fortnite as a reward for encouraging children to do well in school offering their children the purchase of V bucks in exchange for good grades Some parents see potential in their children becoming skilled in Fortnite as to become professional players and compete for part of the large prize pools creating a market for tutors to help children improve their skills in the game At the same time as Fortnite Battle Royale became a social hangout for younger players issues of peer pressure and bullying have been raised Cosmetic skins are seen as a sign of skill and status so younger players spend money to get the rarer skins to appear equal with their friends or may be taunted by other players for not having such skins and using the game s default skins While Fortnite has been successful in its monetization scheme this approach using battle passes and rotating skin availability induces players to continue to spend money in a Keeping up with the Joneses type effect Other issues related to children s interest in Fortnite have been raised Several of the security issues raised around the game are heightened with younger players who may not easily recognize such illicit schemes and put themselves at risk to privacy invasion There is some concern that online child sexual predators would be able to easily make contact with underage players with at least one documented case from Florida Security issues Fortnite s popularity has drawn a network of hackers since March that target accounts with lucrative skins and emotes as to resell those accounts to other users Some of those hackers speaking anonymously to the BBC stated they were making thousands of British pounds a week through these actions Authorities that monitor the dark web have found that Fortnite Battle Royale has become a popular way to engage in credit card fraud criminals with access to stolen credit card information use that to purchase V bucks on a freshly made Fortnite account when they then sell through services like eBay players at a discount often preying on children and young adults with these schemes Separately other security experts such as Check Point have found exploits with Fortnite and its underlying services that allowed hackers to gain access to some accounts enabling them to gain personal details buy V bucks and listen in to the account s owner when they use the game s voice chat system Epic closed a key exploit that enabled this by January A class action lawsuit was filed in August over this breach acknowledging while Epic did fix the problem it failed to notified the users that were affected by it Epic has taken action against players that have used in game hacks like aimbots to gain a competitive edge when these are discovered In one notable case Jarvis Khattri a member of FaZe Clan was given a lifetime Fortnite ban in November after he had posted a video which showed how aimbots within Fortnite worked despite having cautioned his viewers to not use aimbots nor providing details of how to acquire the aimbot The ban was controversial as Khattri had developed his esports career on Fortnite and FaZe Clan had started discussions with Epic Games to reduce the ban in context of the video clip Dance emotes lawsuits The popularity of Fortnite s dance emotes which borrow from dance moves in popular culture have led the creators of these dances to express concern and take legal action about these moves being sold by Epic even though the United States Copyright Office had issued statements that individual dance moves are uncopyrightable These include rapper Milly regarding his Milly Rock and actor Donald Faison related to a dance move he used on the TV show Scrubs Milly has started taking legal action against Epic with copyright infringement over the Milly Rock based dance emote as well as asserting claims against personality rights under California law Actor Alfonso Ribeiro filed a similar suit against Epic for their Fresh emote dance which Ribeiro says was directly based on his character Carlton Banks dance from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air Backpack Kid Russell Horning whose dance move the Floss was popularized through live performance with Katy Perry has also initiated legal action against Epic for copyright infringement of his dance Another lawsuit by the parent of the child that created a popular Orange Shirt Kid dance has also filed a lawsuit against Epic on similar grounds in this case while the child had submitted the dance for an Epic run contest for a new Fortnite dance emote he did not win but fans petitioned Epic to include the dance anyway The lawsuit challenges that the child was not recognized or compensated for the dance move BlocBoy JB filed another suit against Epic over his Shoot dance move represented by the in game Hype emote by late January Jared Nickens and Jaylen Brantley filed a lawsuit against Epic in February seeking US million in damages for Epic s use of their Running Man dance In at least one of these cases that from Milly Epic is seeking the suit to be dismissed claiming that a simple dance move cannot be copyrighted according to guidance issued by the United States Copyright Office In March the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp v Wall Street com an unrelated case that a copyright infringement lawsuit cannot commence until the Copyright office registered the copyright As the Copyright office has refused to register some of these dance emotes as copyrights four of the six pending suits Milly Ribeiro Backpack Kid and Orange Shirt Kid were withdrawn within a few days The firm that represented the four cases Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price Hect stated this was merely a procedural withdrawal until they completed the registrations with the Copyright office A seventh suit was filed by Leo Pellegrino a saxophone player known for his dances during his performances Unlike previous cases Pellegrino s case accuses Epic Games of misappropriation of his trademarked likeness over an in game emote that has a player s character dance while playing a saxophone rather than any specific dance move A federal district judge ruled in March that Fortnite sufficiently transforms Pellegrino s move from his overall likeness to qualify for First Amendment protections and summarily ruled against all but one of Pellegrino s other claims The claim of false endorsement was allowed to remain but still will be reviewed by the courts After receiving a complaint from comedian Matt Geiler over a combination of a dance emote and cosmetic skin that he claimed infringe on his character of the Dancing Pumpkin Man Epic preemptively filed a request to the courts in December to rule that their emote and cosmetics do not infringe on Geiler s trademark or copyright Since then Epic had worked with a dance creator to work the dance emote into the game such as with musician Rick Astley to add a dance based on his song Never Gonna Give You Up commonly associated with rickrolling Similar suits have been filed against the same dance moves used in K Games NBA K games while the offending dance moves were removed in January from the game Forza Horizon though it is unknown if this was due to legal action In the lawsuit involving Ribeiro s dance the Copyright Office had refused to grant Ribeiro a copyright for the dance not only because they considered it a simple dance routine but also because Ribeiro had created the dance in context of another copyrighted work so he would likely be unable to claim ownership Apple and Google lawsuits On August Epic announced it was permanently discounting the price of V bucks across all platforms by except for those purchased directly through the iOS App Store and Google Play storefronts For the mobile platforms Epic created its own purchasing option that allowed players to purchase directly from Epic bypassing Apple and Google Epic said that they could not offer this discount to those purchasing through Apple or Google s storefronts due to the fee both took from each sale which was seen by journalists as yet another means to challenge the fee Later that day both Apple and Google removed Fortnite from their stores both claiming that the payment system violates the store terms The removals prevent players from downloading the game but not playing it if they already own it The game still remained available on the Samsung Galaxy Store for Samsung devices as well as directly from Epic Games via their sideloaded app for all Android devices Epic immediately filed a lawsuit against Apple over unfair and anti competitive actions along with releasing a short Nineteen Eighty Fortnite parodying Apple s advertisement to explain the reasonings for filing the lawsuit Epic filed a similar lawsuit against Google the same day While the game remained playable for users that previously downloaded it its removal from the iOS App Store left Epic the inability to update the game which it used to caution players on social media that they will miss out on the upcoming new season starting August Epic also cautioned macOS similarly that they would be unable to update their version as well Epic was denied a preliminary injunction on August that would have forced Apple to keep the game on the App Store thus leaving the game unable to update on iOS Epic had also believed that Apple was terminating the ability for users with Epic account linked through Apple to log in using their Apple ID by September but Apple confirmed they would not be disabling this feature Following the trial in May the federal judge issued a first ruling in September that included a permanent injunction against Apple that prevented from blocking developers like Epic from including links to alternative payment systems for apps on the App Store BBC reported in November that Epic had worked a deal with Nvidia as to allow iOS players to play Fortnite through the GeForce Now cloud gaming service running within a browser the method which would bypass the requirement for Epic to require Apple to manage the in game purchases The browser based GeForce Now client for iOS was released by November with Fortnite to be added at a later time On May Microsoft released their Cloud based gaming service the second workaround to the Mobile platform issue Anyone with a free Microsoft account can login in and access Fortnite via their mobile devices Other legal issues In January Bluehole s PUBG Corp the South Korean company behind PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds PUBG filed a lawsuit against Epic Games claiming that Fortnite Battle Royale was a copyright infringement of Battlegrounds they accused Epic Games of copying PUBG s user interface and game items According to Korea Times market observers predicted that there would be little likelihood of Bluehole winning the case as it would be difficult to establish the originality of PUBG in court due to the battle royale game genre which includes both PUBG and Fortnite Battle Royale being derived from the Japanese film Battle Royale The case has since closed with PUBG Corp dropping the lawsuit in June under undisclosed reasons Epic has taken legal action against persons that have signed non disclosure agreements NDAs in regards to leaking information about upcoming game information In May Epic Games filed a lawsuit against quality assurance tester Thomas Hannah after he leaked information regarding Season Hannah who had joined Epic in December breached the NDA by sharing details of the Season with Adam DiMarco DiMarco later shared information in a Reddit post spoiling the theme of the Season Epic stated that Hannah diminished the enjoyment of the people who play or who watch others play Fortnite by ruining the suspense that had been building in the Fortnite community in anticipation of upcoming season Epic also sent FNBRLeaks a group that datamined the files Fortnite to determine new features and events that were likely coming in the near future a cease desist letter in December stating that their reporting of these upcoming features were negatively harming Epic and spoiling the game for the players FNBRLeaks complied with the terms of the letter Epic initiated a lawsuit in October against a Fortnite experience tester that leaked details of the Chapter transition days before the event occurred which included details of the map and mechanics stating the tester broke confidentiality agreements Epic filed a second similar lawsuit in November against a tester out of Keywords Studio in Montreal over similar Chapter leaks that were in breach of the terms of their non disclosure agreement Epic has also taken action against players who have profited by profiting cheats to other players in Fortnite These suits include In October Epic Games filed civil complaints against two associates of the website Addicted Cheats which for a payment provided cheating services to players The company argued that the two defendants made and used altered game breaking code that was against the End User License Agreement and the Copyright Act Epic filed suit against a minor in who had used cheats in game and advertised these cheats in their YouTube channel videos The case was ultimately settled out of court by February with undisclosed terms In October Epic Games sued YouTuber Brandon Lucas who posts videos on the channel Golden Modz The lawsuit details that Lucas cheats at the game and promotes advertises and sells software that enables those who use it to cheat The lawsuit also names Lucas s secondary website in which visitors are encouraged to purchase the hack and or Fortnite user accounts preloaded with hacks The company that oversees the Coral Castle structure in Miami Dade County Florida filed a lawsuit against Epic Games in August on trademark infringement over use of the name Coral Castle associated with the location the game introduced in Chapter Season The suit contends that the name along with the nautical theme created confusion with their landmark Notes
