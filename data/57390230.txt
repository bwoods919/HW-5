and development Following the conclusion of the third season in October the future of the show had remained in question with no announcement of renewal or status of production In March Harmon tweeted

Co creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland wanted to have assurance that there would be many more seasons of Rick and Morty in the future so that they would be able to focus on the show and minimize their involvement in other projects Harmon had also stated that he wishes for future seasons to consist of more than ten episodes saying Now I m about to do season of Rick and Morty and want to prove that I ve grown This was in reference to him admitting that he should work more efficiently control his perfectionism and avoid past mistakes that had resulted in the third season of the show comprising only ten episodes instead of fourteen as was initially intended In May after prolonged contract negotiations Adult Swim announced a long term deal with the creators ordering new episodes over an unspecified number of seasons The two co creators expressed their satisfaction with Roiland saying We re super excited that for the first time ever we re locked in we know what the future is we have job security Harmon added Justin and I just needed enough episodes and the right kind of deal structure that would give us permission to do what we want to do which is truly focus on the show

McMahan posted images from the writers room on social media which showed Story Circles drawn on a blackboard This eight step storytelling formula developed by Harmon a simplified version of Joseph Campbell s common narrative framework known as the hero s journey was used in previous seasons to outline the narrative arc of an episode It describes how the main character of the story leaves their comfort zone to pursue something they desire how they are forced to adapt to an unfamiliar situation in order to achieve their goal and how the story has changed them as they return to their comfort zone Emmy magazine however reported after an interview with Harmon that the writing team planned to shake things up with a more anarchic writing style This meant a rather deconstructive approach where instead of focusing on story structure attention would be given primarily to cultivating ideas jokes and pieces of dialogue and then the stories would be built around those moments Regarding the season s narrative arc Roiland said that the season would contain strong episodic episodes and advised fans to watch them in the correct order In October series composer Ryan Elder told Inverse that he was expecting to get involved with the season when the writing process would have been partially completed The first guest voice was revealed in November when Sam Neill tweeted that he had enjoyed
