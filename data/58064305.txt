The website s critical consensus reads Despite LeBron James best efforts to make a winning team out of the Tune Squad Space Jam A New Legacy trades the zany meta humor of its predecessor for a shameless and tired exercise in IP driven branding At Metacritic it was assigned a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating generally unfavorable reviews According to Screen Rant writer Jordan Williams the majority of critical reviews targeted the film s lack of fun humor and earnest light heartedness overt promotion of Warner Bros property disappointment with celebrity and NBA roles and the long two hour runtime compared to the first Space Jam s minutes Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale the same as the first film while PostTrak reported of filmgoers gave it a positive score with saying they would definitely recommend it The A V Club s A A Dowd gave it a C stating that the film s comprehensiveness did nothing although it made misdirections which was subject to glittering CGI trash heap of cameos pat life lessons and stale internet catchphrases Writing for the South China Morning Post James Marsh gave the film out of stars and criticized its use of product placement which he felt neglected both supporters of the NBA and Looney Tunes Calling it a supposed family comedy woefully devoid of laughs Marsh concluded that it fell just short of asking audiences point blank to subscribe to HBO Max and was ultimately a vacuous and cynical experience that shoots far wide of the mark In her out of star review Wenlei Ma of News com au criticized the film for overtly promoting Warner Bros IPs saying It s a shame that the cross promotion was so nauseating and over the top because otherwise Space Jam A New Legacy has a lot of value It s more entertaining and better paced than the original the character designs for the opposing team are impressive and it s even used the Looney Tunes characters in a way that stays true to their legacy while also introducing them to a new generation of kids Alonso Duralde of TheWrap said that the film barely has jokes for the Looney Tunes let alone the entire Warner Bros cast of characters and wrote Viewers who for whatever reason love the first Space Jam may well find themselves delighted all over again but as a once in a lifetime opportunity to plunge a beloved sports figure into a century s worth of pop culture iconography A New Legacy is a big fat airball Hagan Osborne of FilmInk was more positive about the film writing What is most thrilling about A New Legacy is the liveliness of the worlds created with each destination carrying with it a varying style of animation that brings with it added freshness Amy Nicholson of Variety said Space Jam A New Legacy is chaotic rainbow sprinkle colored nonsense that unlike the original manages to hold together as a movie Kristen Page Kirby writing for The Washington Post gave the film a score of stars out of saying There s no real reason for this sequel tribute to the original film to exist but now that it does there s no reason to wish that it didn t and added that the film has just enough momentum heart and spirit even as it does both way too much and not quite enough If this is corporate synergy fired up to a terrifying new level there s still enough heart at the movie s center to keep it from becoming all business Korey Coleman and Martin Thomas of Double Toasted the former of whom worked as an animator on the original Space Jam both gave it a positive review While they admitted that the film felt like an advertisement for HBO Max they praised the creative use of the characters and the acting though they took issue with some of the outdated references Keith Hawkes of Parent Previews criticized the film saying I think I d rather watch an actual dumpster fire stench and all At least the fire wouldn t be trying to advertise and it would probably have the common courtesy not to take the two hours this movie brutally extracted from my life In case you re still on the fence I ve seen over films for this job This is easily one of the worst Brian Lowry of CNN wrote The first Space Jam was hardly a classic which should temper expectations Yet even by that standard this marketing driven exercise too often plays like the Acme version of it Simran Hans of The Guardian gave a out of stars and wrote The sequel on the other hand seems to earnestly revel in the recyclable potential of the WB archive Its elastic mile a minute animated sequences insert Lola Bunny Zendaya wasted into the world of Wonder Woman and send Tweety and Granny into The Matrix James s natural charisma should allow the film to soar but he s bogged down by an avalanche of distracting cameos from Gremlins to Game of Thrones Mary Sollosi of Entertainment Weekly give a film a D grade and saying Here s the thing about basketball It is extremely watchable Here s the thing about Space Jam A New Legacy It s not Joe Pytka the director of the original Space Jam expressed his hatred towards the film upon its release Among his complaints Pytka compared LeBron James to Michael Jordan who was arguably the most famous celebrity when the first film was released in comparison to James criticized the story for not tying up emotionally to LeBron s life felt the first film s cast and soundtrack were superior to the ones of A New Legacy and saw Bugs Bunny s role in the film as heartbreaking Pytka had earlier criticized Warner Bros decision to make a Space Jam sequel in back when Justin Lin was attached to direct dismissing the notion as ridiculous despite working with LeBron James and Steph Curry feeling that neither of them was a transcendent figure like Jordan In October Hwang Dong hyuk the creator of Korean television series Squid Game criticized James final moments in each episodes of the scene in the protagonist Seong Gi hun portrayed by Lee Jung jae saying Have you seen Space Jam LeBron James is cool and can say what he wants I respect that I m very thankful he watched the whole series But I wouldn t change my ending That s my ending If he has his own ending that would satisfy him maybe he could make his own sequel I ll check it out and maybe send him a message saying I liked your whole show except the ending Accolades At the nd Golden Raspberry Awards Space Jam A New Legacy
