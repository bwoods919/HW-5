Solar Opposites is very much its own comedic beast Co creator Justin Roiland and his team inject the same amount of hilarity and creativity into this alien centric show as he did with the former series Also the side adventures in The Wall should ve garnered some nominations by themselves as they made for an outstanding show within the show Accolades Notes References External links Solar
