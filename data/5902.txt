title: Capital punishment
id: 5902
Capital punishment also known as the death penalty and formerly called judicial homicide is the state sanctioned practice of killing a person as a punishment for a crime usually following an authorized rule governed process to conclude that the person is responsible for violating norms that warrant said punishment The sentence ordering that an offender be punished in such a manner is known as a death sentence and the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an execution A prisoner who has been sentenced to death and awaits execution is condemned and is commonly referred to as being on death row Etymologically the term capital lit of the head derived via the Latin capitalis from caput head refers to execution by beheading but executions are carried out by many methods including hanging shooting lethal injection stoning electrocution and gassing Crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes capital offences or capital felonies and vary depending on the jurisdiction but commonly include serious crimes against the person such as murder mass murder aggravated cases of rape often including child sexual abuse terrorism aircraft hijacking war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide along with crimes against the state such as attempting to overthrow government treason espionage sedition and piracy Also in some cases acts of recidivism aggravated robbery and kidnapping in addition to drug trafficking drug dealing and drug possession are capital crimes or enhancements However states have also imposed punitive executions for an expansive range of conduct for political or religious beliefs and practices for a status beyond one s control or without employing any significant due process procedures Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of an innocent person by means of capital punishment For example the executions following the show trials in Russia during the Great Purge of were an instrument of political repression As of the end of countries retain capital punishment countries have completely abolished it de jure for all crimes seven have abolished it for ordinary crimes while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes and are abolitionist in practice Although the majority of nations have abolished capital punishment over of the world s population live in countries where the death penalty is retained such as China India the United States Singapore Indonesia Pakistan Bangladesh Nigeria Egypt Saudi Arabia Iran Japan and Taiwan Capital punishment is controversial with many people organizations and religious groups holding differing views on whether or not it is ethically permissible Amnesty International declares that the death penalty breaches human rights stating the right to life and the right to live free from torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment These rights are protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in In the European Union EU Article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the use of capital punishment The Council of Europe which has member states has sought to abolish the use of the death penalty by its members absolutely through Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights However this only affects those member states which have signed and ratified it and they do not include Armenia and Azerbaijan The United Nations General Assembly has adopted throughout the years from to eight non binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions with a view to eventual abolition History Execution of criminals and dissidents has been used by nearly all societies since the beginning of civilizations on Earth Until the nineteenth century without developed prison systems there was frequently no workable alternative to ensure deterrence and incapacitation of criminals In pre modern times the executions themselves often involved torture with cruel and painful methods such as the breaking wheel keelhauling sawing hanging drawing and quartering burning at the stake flaying slow slicing boiling alive impalement mazzatello blowing from a gun schwedentrunk and scaphism Other methods which appear only in legend include the blood eagle and brazen bull The use of formal execution extends to the beginning of recorded history Most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system Communal punishments for wrongdoing generally included blood money compensation by the wrongdoer corporal punishment shunning banishment and execution In tribal societies compensation and shunning were often considered enough as a form of justice The response to crimes committed by neighbouring tribes clans or communities included a formal apology compensation blood feuds and tribal warfare A blood feud or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails or an arbitration system is non existent This form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion It may result from crime land disputes or a code of honour Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies as well as potential allies that injury to property rights or the person will not go unpunished In most countries that practice capital punishment it is now reserved for murder terrorism war crimes espionage treason or as part of military justice In some countries sexual crimes such as rape fornication adultery incest sodomy and bestiality carry the death penalty as do religious crimes such as Hudud Zina and Qisas crimes such as apostasy formal renunciation of the state religion blasphemy moharebeh hirabah Fasad Mofsed e filarz and witchcraft In many countries that use the death penalty drug trafficking and often drug possession is also a capital offence In China human trafficking and serious cases of corruption and financial crimes are punished by the death penalty In militaries around the world courts martial have imposed death sentences for offences such as cowardice desertion insubordination and mutiny Ancient history Elaborations of tribal arbitration of feuds included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system Compensation was based on the principle of substitution which might include material for example cattle slaves land compensation exchange of brides or grooms or payment of the blood debt Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood or transfers of property or blood money or in some case an offer of a person for execution The person offered for execution did not have to be an original perpetrator of the crime because the social system was based on tribes and clans not individuals Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings such as the Norsemen things Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts for example trial by combat or blood money One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the duel In certain parts of the world nations in the form of ancient republics monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged These nations were often united by common linguistic religious or family ties Moreover expansion of these nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations Consequently various classes of royalty nobility various commoners and slaves emerged Accordingly the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged into a more unified system of justice which formalized the relation between the different social classes rather than tribes The earliest and most famous example is Code of Hammurabi which set the different punishment and compensation according to the different class or group of victims and perpetrators The Torah Old Testament lays down the death penalty for murder kidnapping practicing magic violation of the Sabbath blasphemy and a wide range of sexual crimes although evidence suggests that actual executions were exceedingly rare if they occurred at all A further example comes from Ancient Greece where the Athenian legal system replacing customary oral law was first written down by Draco in about BC the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes though Solon later repealed Draco s code and published new laws retaining capital punishment only for intentional homicide and only with victim s family permission The word draconian derives from Draco s laws The Romans also used the death penalty for a wide range of offences Ancient Greece Protagoras whose thought is reported by Plato criticizes the principle of revenge because once the damage is done it cannot be canceled by any action So if the death penalty is to be imposed by society it is only to protect the latter against the criminal or for a dissuasive purpose The only right that Protagoras knows is therefore human right which established and sanctioned by a sovereign collectivity identifies itself with positive or the law in force of the city In fact it finds its guarantee in the death penalty which threatens all those who do not respect it Plato for his part saw the death penalty as a means of purification because crimes are a defilement Thus in the Laws he considered necessary the execution of the animal or the destruction of the object which caused the death of a Man by accident For the murderers he considered that the act of homicide is not natural and is not fully consented by the criminal Homicide is thus a disease of the soul which must be reeducated as much as possible and as a last resort sentence to death if no rehabilitation is possible According to Aristotle for whom free will is proper to man the citizen is responsible for his acts If there was a crime a judge must define the penalty allowing the crime to be annulled by compensating it This is how pecuniary compensation appeared for criminals the least recalcitrant and whose rehabilitation is deemed possible But for others the death penalty is necessary according to Aristotle This philosophy aims on the one hand to protect society and on the other hand to compensate to cancel the consequences of the crime committed It inspired Western criminal law until the th century a time when the first reflections on the abolition of the death penalty appeared Ancient Rome In ancient Rome the application of the death penalty against Roman citizens was unusual and considered exceptional They preferred alternative sentences ranging depending on the crime and the criminal from private or public reprimand to exile including the confiscation of his property or torture or even prison and as a last resort death A historic debate followed by a vote took place in the Roman Senate to decide the fate of Catiline s allies when he tried to take power in December Then Roman consul argued in favor of the killing of conspirators without judgment by decision of the Senate Senatus consultum ultimum and was supported by the majority of senators among the minority voices opposed to the execution most notable was that of Julius Caesar The custom was quite different for foreigners who were considered inferior to Roman citizens and especially for slaves who were considered transferrable property China Although many are executed in the People s Republic of China each year in the present day there was a time in the Tang dynasty when the death penalty was abolished This was in the year enacted by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang r When abolishing the death penalty Xuanzong ordered his officials to refer to the nearest regulation by analogy when sentencing those found guilty of crimes for which the prescribed punishment was execution Thus depending on the severity of the crime a punishment of severe scourging with the thick rod or of exile to the remote Lingnan region might take the place of capital punishment However the death penalty was restored only years later in in response to the An Lushan Rebellion At this time in the Tang dynasty only the emperor had the authority to sentence criminals to execution Under Xuanzong capital punishment was relatively infrequent with only executions in the year and executions in the year The two most common forms of execution in the Tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation which were the prescribed methods of execution for and offences respectively Strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against one s parents or grandparents with a magistrate scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb Decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition Despite the great discomfort involved most of the Tang Chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation as a result of the traditional Tang Chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is therefore disrespectful to one s ancestors to die without returning one s body to the grave intact Some further forms of capital punishment were practiced in the Tang dynasty of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal The first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod which was common throughout the Tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption The second was truncation in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death A further form of execution called Ling Chi slow slicing or death by of a thousand cuts was used from the close of the Tang dynasty around to its abolition in When a minister of the fifth grade or above received a death sentence the emperor might grant him a special dispensation allowing him to commit suicide in lieu of execution Even when this privilege was not granted the law required that the condemned minister be provided with food and ale by his keepers and transported to the execution ground in a cart rather than having to walk there Nearly all executions under the Tang dynasty took place in public as a warning to the population The heads of the executed were displayed on poles or spears When local authorities decapitated a convicted criminal the head was boxed and sent to the capital as proof of identity and that the execution had taken place Middle Ages In medieval and early modern Europe before the development of modern prison systems the death penalty was also used as a generalized form of punishment for even minor offences In early modern Europe a massive moral panic regarding witchcraft swept across Europe and later the European colonies in North America During this period there were widespread claims that malevolent Satanic witches were operating as an organized threat to Christendom As a result tens of thousands of women were prosecuted for witchcraft and executed through the witch trials of the early modern period between the th and th centuries The death penalty also targeted sexual offences such as sodomy In the early history of Islam th th centuries there is a number of purported but mutually inconsistent reports athar regarding the punishments of sodomy ordered by some of the early caliphs Abu Bakr the first caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate apparently recommended toppling a wall on the culprit or else burning him alive while Ali ibn Abi Talib is said to have ordered death by stoning for one sodomite and had another thrown head first from the top of the highest building in the town according to Ibn Abbas the latter punishment must be followed by stoning Other medieval Muslim leaders such as the Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad most notably al Mu tadid were often cruel in their punishments In early modern England the Buggery Act stipulated hanging as punishment for buggery James Pratt and John Smith were the last two Englishmen to be executed for sodomy in In the laws of Puritan governed Plymouth Colony included a sentence of death for sodomy and buggery The Massachusetts Bay Colony followed in Throughout the th century U S states repealed death sentences from their sodomy laws with South Carolina being the last to do so in Historians recognize that during the Early Middle Ages the Christian populations living in the lands invaded by the Arab Muslim armies between the th and th centuries suffered religious discrimination religious persecution religious violence and martyrdom multiple times at the hands of Arab Muslim officials and rulers As People of the Book Christians under Muslim rule were subjected to dhimmi status along with Jews Samaritans Gnostics Mandeans and Zoroastrians which was inferior to the status of Muslims Christians and other religious minorities thus faced religious discrimination and religious persecution in that they were banned from proselytising for Christians it was forbidden to evangelize or spread Christianity in the lands invaded by the Arab Muslims on pain of death they were banned from bearing arms undertaking certain professions and were obligated to dress differently in order to distinguish themselves from Arabs Under sharia Non Muslims were obligated to pay jizya and kharaj taxes together with periodic heavy ransom levied upon Christian communities by Muslim rulers in order to fund military campaigns all of which contributed a significant proportion of income to the Islamic states while conversely reducing many Christians to poverty and these financial and social hardships forced many Christians to convert to Islam Christians unable to pay these taxes were forced to surrender their children to the Muslim rulers as payment who would sell them as slaves to Muslim households where they were forced to convert to Islam Many Christian martyrs were executed under the Islamic death penalty for defending their Christian faith through dramatic acts of resistance such as refusing to convert to Islam repudiation of the Islamic religion and subsequent reconversion to Christianity and blasphemy towards Muslim beliefs Despite the wide use of the death penalty calls for reform were not unknown The th century Jewish legal scholar Moses Maimonides wrote It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof until we would be convicting merely according to the judge s caprice Maimonides s concern was maintaining popular respect for law and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission Enlightenment philosophy While during the Middle Ages the expiatory aspect of the death penalty was taken into account this is no longer the case under the Lumi res These define the place of man within society no longer according to a divine rule but as a contract established at birth between the citizen and the society it is the social contract From that moment on capital punishment should be seen as useful to society through its dissuasive effect but also as a means of protection of the latter vis vis criminals Modern era In the last several centuries with the emergence of modern nation states justice came to be increasingly associated with the concept of natural and legal rights The period saw an increase in standing police forces and permanent penitential institutions Rational choice theory a utilitarian approach to criminology which justifies punishment as a form of deterrence as opposed to retribution can be traced back to Cesare Beccaria whose influential treatise On Crimes and Punishments was the first detailed analysis of capital punishment to demand the abolition of the death penalty In England Jeremy Bentham the founder of modern utilitarianism called for the abolition of the death penalty Beccaria and later Charles Dickens and Karl Marx noted the incidence of increased violent criminality at the times and places of executions Official recognition of this phenomenon led to executions being carried out inside prisons away from public view In England in the th century when there was no police force Parliament drastically increased the number of capital offences to more than These were mainly property offences for example cutting down a cherry tree in an orchard In there were including crimes such as shoplifting petty theft or stealing cattle The severity of the so called Bloody Code was often tempered by juries who refused to convict or judges in the case of petty theft who arbitrarily set the value stolen at below the statutory level for a capital crime th century In Nazi Germany there were three types of capital punishment hanging decapitation and death by shooting Also modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline In the past cowardice absence without leave desertion insubordination shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were often crimes punishable by death see decimation and running the gauntlet One method of execution since firearms came into common use has also been firing squad although some countries use execution with a single shot to the head or neck Various authoritarian states for example those with Fascist or Communist governments employed the death penalty as a potent means of political oppression According to Robert Conquest the leading expert on Joseph Stalin s purges more than one million Soviet citizens were executed during the Great Purge of almost all by a bullet to the back of the head Mao Zedong publicly stated that people had been executed in China during the Cultural Revolution Partly as a response to such excesses civil rights organizations started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of human rights and an abolition of the death penalty Contemporary era By continent all European states but one have abolished capital punishment many Oceanian states have abolished it most states in the Americas have abolished its use while a few actively retain it less than half of countries in Africa retain it and the majority of countries in Asia retain it Abolition was often adopted due to political change as when countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy or when it became an entry condition for the EU The United States is a notable exception some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades the earliest being Michigan where it was abolished in while other states still actively use it today The death penalty in the United States remains a contentious issue which is hotly debated In retentionist countries the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has occurred though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty In abolitionist countries the debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal murders though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it However a spike in serious violent crimes such as murders or terrorist attacks has prompted some countries to effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty One notable example is Pakistan which in December lifted a six year moratorium on executions after the Peshawar school massacre during which students and members of staff of the Army Public School and Degree College Peshawar were killed by Tehrik i Taliban Pakistan terrorists a group distinct from the Afghan Taliban who condemned the attack Since then Pakistan has executed over convicts In two major countries Turkey and the Philippines saw their executives making moves to reinstate the death penalty In the same year passage of the law in the Philippines failed to obtain the Senate s approval On December after a year moratorium the Kazakhstan government enacted the On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the Abolition of the Death Penalty signed by President Kassym Jomart Tokayev as part of series of Omnibus reformations of the Kazak legal system Listening State initiative History of abolition In AD in Japan the death penalty was banned during the reign of Emperor Sh mu but the abolition only lasted a few years In Emperor Saga abolished the death penalty under the influence of Shinto and it lasted until In China the death penalty was banned by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang in replacing it with exile or scourging However the ban only lasted years Following his conversion to Christianity in Vladimir the Great abolished the death penalty in Kievan Rus along with torture and mutilation corporal punishment was also seldom used In England a public statement of opposition was included in The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards written in Sir Thomas More s Utopia published in debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form coming to no firm conclusion More was himself executed for treason in More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian Cesare Beccaria Dei Delitti e Delle Pene On Crimes and Punishments published in In this book Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice but even the futility from the point of view of social welfare of torture and the death penalty Influenced by the book Grand Duke Leopold II of Habsburg the future Emperor of Austria abolished the death penalty in the then independent Grand Duchy of Tuscany the first permanent abolition in modern times On November after having de facto blocked executions the last was in Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land In Tuscany s regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on November to commemorate the event The event is commemorated on this day by cities around the world celebrating Cities for Life Day In the United Kingdom it was abolished for murder leaving only treason piracy with violence arson in royal dockyards and a number of wartime military offences as capital crimes for a five year experiment in and permanently in the last execution having taken place in It was abolished for all offences in Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights first entering into force in prohibits the death penalty in all circumstances for those states that are party to it including the United Kingdom from In the post classical Republic of Poljica life was ensured as a basic right in its Poljica Statute of The short lived revolutionary Roman Republic banned capital punishment in Venezuela followed suit and abolished the death penalty in and San Marino did so in The last execution in San Marino had taken place in In Portugal after legislative proposals in and the death penalty was abolished in The last execution in Brazil was from then on all the condemnations were commuted by the Emperor Pedro II until its abolition for civil offences and military offences in peacetime in The penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated and abolished again twice and but on those occasions it was restricted to acts of terrorism or subversion considered internal warfare and all sentences were commuted and not carried out Abolition occurred in Canada in except for some military offences with complete abolition in in France in and in Australia in although the state of Western Australia retained the penalty until In South Australia under the premiership of then Premier Dunstan the Criminal Law Consolidation Act SA was modified so that the death sentence was changed to life imprisonment in In the United Nations General Assembly affirmed in a formal resolution that throughout the world it is desirable to progressively restrict the number of offences for which the death penalty might be imposed with a view to the desirability of abolishing this punishment In the United States Michigan was the first state to ban the death penalty on May The death penalty was declared unconstitutional between and based on the Furman v Georgia case but the Gregg v Georgia case once again permitted the death penalty under certain circumstances Further limitations were placed on the death penalty in Atkins v Virginia death penalty unconstitutional for people with an intellectual disability and Roper v Simmons death penalty unconstitutional if defendant was under age at the time the crime was committed In the United States states and the District of Columbia ban capital punishment Many countries have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice Since World War II there has been a trend toward abolishing capital punishment Capital punishment has been completely abolished by countries a further seven have done so for all offences except under special circumstances and more have abolished it in practice because they have not used it for at least years and are believed to have a policy or established practice against carrying out executions Contemporary use By country Most nations including almost all developed countries have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice notable exceptions are the United States Japan Taiwan Singapore and South Korea Additionally capital punishment is also carried out in China India and most Islamic states Since World War II there has been a trend toward abolishing the death penalty countries retain the death penalty in active use countries have abolished capital punishment altogether have done so for all offences except under special circumstances and more have abolished it in practice because they have not used it for at least years and are believed to have a policy or established practice against carrying out executions According to Amnesty International countries are known to have performed executions in There are countries which do not publish information on the use of capital punishment most significantly China and North Korea According to Amnesty International around prisoners were executed in Amnesty reported in and that Singapore and Iraq respectively had the world s highest per capita execution rate According to Al Jazeera and UN Special Rapporteur Ahmed Shaheed Iran has had the world s highest per capita execution rate A EU report from the Directorate General for External Relations policy department pointed to Gaza as having the highest per capita execution rate in the MENA region The use of the death penalty is becoming increasingly restrained in some retentionist countries including Taiwan and Singapore Indonesia carried out no executions between November and March Singapore Japan and the United States are the only developed countries that are classified by Amnesty International as retentionist South Korea is classified as abolitionist in practice Nearly all retentionist countries are situated in Asia Africa and the Caribbean The only retentionist country in Europe is Belarus During the s the democratisation of Latin America swelled the ranks of abolitionist countries This was soon followed by the fall of Communism in Europe Many of the countries which restored democracy aspired to enter the EU The EU and the Council of Europe both strictly require member states not to practice the death penalty see Capital punishment in Europe Public support for the death penalty in the EU varies The last execution in a member state of the present day Council of Europe took place in in Ukraine In contrast the rapid industrialization in Asia has seen an increase in the number of developed countries which are also retentionist In these countries the death penalty retains strong public support and the matter receives little attention from the government or the media in China there is a small but significant and growing movement to abolish the death penalty altogether This trend has been followed by some African and Middle Eastern countries where support for the death penalty remains high Some countries have resumed practicing the death penalty after having previously suspended the practice for long periods The United States suspended executions in but resumed them in there was no execution in India between and and Sri Lanka declared an end to its moratorium on the death penalty on November although it has not yet performed any further executions The Philippines re introduced the death penalty in after abolishing it in but again abolished it in The United States and Japan are

the United States since it reinstated the death penalty in Japan has inmates with finalized death sentences as of January after Miyuki Ueta who was convicted of murdering two men in Tottori Prefecture in died of asphyxiation after choking on food at the Hiroshima Detention House The most recent country to abolish the death penalty was Kazakhstan on January after a moratorium dating back decades According to an Amnesty International report released in April Egypt ranked regionally third and globally fifth among the countries that carried out most executions in The country increasingly ignored international human rights concerns and criticism In March Egypt executed prisoners in a jail who were convicted in cases of murder theft and shooting According to Amnesty International s report at least people were executed in despite the COVID pandemic The figure excluded the countries that classify death penalty data as state secret The top five executioners for were China Iran Egypt Iraq and Saudi Arabia Modern day public opinion The public opinion on the death penalty varies considerably by country and by the crime in question Countries where a majority of people are against execution include Norway where only are in favour Most French Finns and Italians also oppose the death penalty A Gallup poll shows that of Americans support the death penalty for an individual convicted of murder down from in in in and in In of Italians expressed support for the death penalty In Taiwan polls and research have consistently shown strong support for the death penalty at This includes a survey conducted by the National Development Council of Taiwan in showing that of Taiwanese people disagree with abolishing the death penalty Its continuation of the practice drew criticism from local rights groups The support and sentencing of capital punishment has been growing in India in the s due to anger over several recent brutal cases of rape even though actual executions are comparatively rare While support for the death penalty for murder is still high in China executions have dropped precipitously with executed in versus in A poll in South Africa where capital punishment is abolished found that of millennial South Africans support re introduction of the death penalty due to increasing incidents of rape and murder A poll found younger Mexicans are more likely to support capital punishment than older ones of Brazilians support the death penalty The age group that shows the greatest support for execution of those condemned is the to year old category in which say they are in favor A poll by Research Co found that percent of Canadians are in favour of reinstating the death penalty for murder in their country In April a poll found that of Britons said they would support reinstating the death penalty for those convicted of terrorism in the UK About a quarter of respondents said they would be opposed In an Ipsos Sopra Steria survey showed that of the French people support re introduction of the death penalty this was an increase Juvenile offenders The death penalty for juvenile offenders criminals aged under years at the time of their crime although the legal or accepted definition of juvenile offender may vary from one jurisdiction to another has become increasingly rare Considering the age of majority is not in some countries or has not been clearly defined in law since ten countries have executed offenders who were considered juveniles at the time of their crimes The People s Republic of China PRC Bangladesh Democratic Republic of Congo Iran Iraq Japan Nigeria Pakistan Saudi Arabia Sudan the United States and Yemen China Pakistan the United States Yemen and Saudi Arabia have since raised the minimum age to Amnesty International has recorded verified executions since then in several countries of both juveniles and adults who had been convicted of committing their offences as juveniles The PRC does not allow for the execution of those under but child executions have reportedly taken place One of the youngest children ever to be executed was the infant son of Perotine Massey on or around July His mother was one of the Guernsey Martyrs who was executed for heresy and his father had previously fled the island At less than one day old he was ordered to be burned by Bailiff Hellier Gosselin with the advice of priests nearby who said the boy should burn due to having inherited moral stain from his mother who had given birth during her execution Starting from in Colonial America until the present day in the United States an estimated juvenile offenders were executed by various colonial authorities and after the American Revolution the federal government The U S Supreme Court abolished capital punishment for offenders under the age of in Thompson v Oklahoma and for all juveniles in Roper v Simmons In Prussia children under the age of were exempted from the death penalty in Capital punishment was cancelled by the

military law during wartime Between and May Iran Pakistan Saudi Arabia Sudan and Yemen were reported to have executed child offenders the largest number occurring in Iran During Hassan Rouhani s tenure as president of Iran from until at least death sentences have been carried out This includes the executions of juvenile offenders The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which forbids capital punishment for juveniles under article a has been signed by all countries and subsequently ratified by all signatories with the exception of the United States despite the US Supreme Court decisions abolishing the practice The UN Sub Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law A majority of countries are also party to the U N International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights whose Article also states that Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age Iran despite its ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was the world s largest executioner of juvenile offenders for which it has been the subject of broad international condemnation the country s record is the focus of the Stop Child Executions Campaign But on February Iran s parliament changed controversial laws relating to the execution of juveniles In the new legislation the age of solar year would be applied to accused of both genders and juvenile offenders must be sentenced pursuant to a separate law specifically dealing with juveniles Based on the Islamic law which now seems to have been revised girls at the age of and boys at of lunar year days shorter than a solar year are deemed fully responsible for their crimes Iran accounted for two thirds of the global total of such executions and currently has approximately people considered as juveniles awaiting execution for crimes committed up from in The past executions of Mahmoud Asgari Ayaz Marhoni and Makwan Moloudzadeh became the focus of Iran s child capital punishment policy and the judicial system that hands down such sentences Saudi Arabia also executes criminals who were minors at the time of the offence In Saudi Arabia was the center of an international controversy after it executed Rizana Nafeek a Sri Lankan domestic worker who was believed to have been years old at the time of the crime Saudi Arabia banned execution for minors except for terrorism cases in April Japan has not executed juvenile criminals after August when they executed Norio Nagayama a spree killer who had been convicted of shooting four people dead in the late s Nagayama s case created the eponymously named Nagayama standards which take into account factors such as the number of victims brutality and social impact of the crimes The standards have been used in determining whether to apply the death sentence in murder cases Teruhiko Seki convicted of murdering four family members including a year old daughter and raping a year old daughter of a family in became the second inmate

the prisoner requests it or if lethal injection is unavailable Inert gas asphyxiation Some U S states Oklahoma Mississippi Alabama Public execution A public execution is a form of capital punishment which members of the general public may voluntarily attend This definition excludes the presence of a small number of witnesses randomly selected to assure executive accountability While today the great majority of the world considers public executions to be distasteful and most countries have outlawed the practice throughout much of history executions were performed publicly as a means for the state to demonstrate its power before those who fell under its jurisdiction be they criminals enemies or political opponents Additionally it afforded the public a chance to witness what was considered a great spectacle Social historians note that beginning in the th century in the U S and western Europe death in general became increasingly shielded from public view occurring more and more behind the closed doors of the hospital Executions were likewise moved behind the walls of the penitentiary The last formal public executions occurred in in Britain in in the U S and in in France According to Amnesty International in public executions were known to have been carried out in Iran North Korea Saudi Arabia and Somalia There have been reports of public executions carried out by state and non state actors in Hamas controlled Gaza Syria Iraq Afghanistan and Yemen Executions which can be classified as public were also carried out in the U S states of Florida and Utah as of Capital crime Crimes against humanity Crimes against humanity such as genocide are usually punishable by death in countries retaining capital punishment Death sentences for such crimes were handed down and carried out during the Nuremberg Trials in and the Tokyo Trials in but the current International Criminal Court does not use capital punishment The maximum penalty available to the International Criminal Court is life imprisonment Murder Intentional homicide is punishable by death in most countries retaining capital punishment but generally provided it involves an aggravating factor required by statute or judicial precedents Some countries including Singapore and Malaysia made the death penalty mandatory for murder though Singapore later changed its laws since to reserve the mandatory death sentence for intentional murder while providing an alternative sentence of life imprisonment with without caning for murder with no intention to cause death which allowed some convicted murderers on death row in Singapore including Kho Jabing to apply for the reduction of their death sentences after the courts in Singapore confirmed that they committed murder without the intention to kill and thus eligible for re sentencing under the new death penalty laws in Singapore In October the Malaysian Government imposed a moratorium on all executions until the passage of a new law that would abolish the death penalty In April legislation abolishing the mandatory death penalty was passed in Malaysia The death penalty would be retained but courts have the discretion to replace it with other punishments including whipping and imprisonment of years Drug trafficking In at least countries retained the death penalty for drug trafficking drug dealing drug possession and related offences People had been regularly sentenced to death and executed for drug related offences in China Indonesia Iran Malaysia Saudi Arabia Singapore and Vietnam Other countries may retain the death penalty for symbolic purposes The death penalty was mandated for drug trafficking in Singapore and Malaysia Since Singapore ruled that those who were certified to have diminished responsibility e g Major depressive disorder or acting as drug couriers and had assisted the authorities in tackling drug related activities would be sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death with the offender liable to at least strokes of the cane if he was not sentenced to death and was simultaneously sentenced to caning as well Drug courier Yong Vui Kong s death sentence was replaced with a life sentence and strokes of the cane in November In April legislation abolishing the mandatory death penalty was passed in Malaysia Other offences Other crimes that are punishable by death in some countries include Terrorism Treason a capital crime in most countries that retain capital punishment Espionage Crimes against the state such as attempting to overthrow government most countries with the death penalty

Hirabah brigandage armed or aggravated robbery Algeria Saudi Arabia Iran Kenya Zambia Ghana Ethiopia the US state of Georgia etc Controversy and debate Death penalty opponents regard the death penalty as inhumane and criticize it for its irreversibility They argue also that capital punishment lacks deterrent effect or has a brutalization effect discriminates against minorities and the poor and that it encourages a culture of violence There are many organizations worldwide such as Amnesty International and country specific such as the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU that have abolition of the death penalty as its main purpose Advocates of the death penalty argue that it deters crime is a good tool for police and prosecutors in plea bargaining makes sure that convicted criminals do not offend again and that it ensures justice for crimes such as homicide where other penalties will not inflict the desired retribution demanded by the crime itself Capital punishment for non lethal crimes is usually considerably more controversial and abolished in many of the countries that retain it Retribution Supporters of the death penalty argued that death penalty is morally justified when applied in murder especially with aggravating elements such as for murder of police officers child murder torture murder multiple homicide and mass killing such as terrorism massacre and genocide This argument is strongly defended by New York Law School s Professor Robert Blecker who says that the punishment must be painful in proportion to the crime Eighteenth century philosopher Immanuel Kant defended a more extreme position according to which every murderer deserves to die on the grounds that loss of life is incomparable to any penalty that allows them to remain alive including life imprisonment Some abolitionists argue that retribution is simply revenge and cannot be condoned Others while accepting retribution as an element of criminal justice nonetheless argue that life without parole is a sufficient substitute It is also argued that the punishing of a killing with another death is a relatively unusual punishment for a violent act because in general violent crimes are not punished by subjecting the perpetrator to a similar act e g rapists are typically not punished by corporal punishment although it may be inflicted in Singapore for example Human rights Abolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of human rights because the right to life is the most important and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a psychological torture Human rights activists oppose the death penalty calling it cruel inhuman and degrading punishment Amnesty International considers it to be the ultimate irreversible denial of Human Rights Albert Camus wrote in a book called Reflections on the Guillotine Resistance Rebellion Death An execution is not simply death It is just as different from the privation of life as a concentration camp is from prison For there to be an equivalency the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who from that moment onward had confined him at his mercy for months Such a monster is not encountered in private life In the classic doctrine of natural rights as expounded by for instance Locke and Blackstone on the other hand it is an important idea that the right to life can be forfeited as most other rights can be given due process is observed such as the right to property and the right to freedom including provisionally in anticipation of an actual verdict As John Stuart Mill explained in a speech given in Parliament against an amendment to abolish capital punishment for murder in And we may imagine somebody asking how we can teach people not to inflict suffering by ourselves inflicting it But to this I should answer all of us would answer that to deter by suffering from inflicting suffering is not only possible but the very purpose of penal justice Does fining a criminal show want of respect for property or imprisoning him for personal freedom Just as unreasonable is it to think that to take the life of a man who has taken that of another is to show want of regard for human life We show on the contrary most emphatically our regard for it by the adoption of a rule that he who violates that right in another forfeits it for himself and that while no other crime that he can commit deprives him of his right to live this shall In one of the most recent cases relating to the death penalty in Singapore activists like Jolovan Wham Kirsten Han and Kokila Annamalai and even the international groups like the United Nations and European Union argued for Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam who has been on death row at Singapore s Changi Prison since should not be executed due to an alleged intellectual disability as they argued that Nagaenthran has low IQ of and a psychiatrist has assessed him to be mentally impaired to an extent that he should not be held liable to his crime and execution They also cited international law where a country should be prohibiting the execution of mentally and intellectually impaired people in order to push for Singapore to commute Nagaenthran s death penalty to life imprisonment based on protection of human rights However the Singapore government and both Singapore s High Court and Court of Appeal maintained their firm stance that despite his certified low IQ it is confirmed that Nagaenthran is not mentally or intellectually disabled based on the joint opinion of three government psychiatrists as he is able to fully understand the magnitude of his actions and has no problem in his daily functioning of life Despite the international outcry Nagaenthran was executed on April Non painful execution Trends in most of the world have long been to move to private and less painful executions France developed the guillotine for this reason in the final years of the th century while Britain banned hanging drawing and quartering in the early th century Hanging by turning the victim off a ladder or by kicking a stool or a bucket which causes death by strangulation was replaced by long drop hanging where the subject is dropped a longer distance to dislocate the neck and sever the spinal cord Mozaffar ad Din Shah Qajar Shah of Persia introduced throat cutting and blowing from a gun close range cannon fire as quick and relatively painless alternatives to more torturous methods of executions used at that time In the United States electrocution and gas inhalation were introduced as more humane alternatives to hanging but have been almost entirely superseded by lethal injection A small number of countries for example Iran and Saudi Arabia still employ slow hanging methods decapitation and stoning A study of executions carried out in the United States between and indicated that at least of the executions or involved unanticipated problems or delays that caused at least arguably unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner The rate of these botched executions remained steady over the period of the study A separate study published in The Lancet in found that in of cases of lethal injection the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness However the U S Supreme Court ruled in Baze v Rees and again in Glossip v Gross that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment In Bucklew v Precythe the majority verdict written by Judge Neil Gorsuch further affirmed this principle stating that while the ban on cruel and unusual punishment affirmatively bans penalties that deliberately inflict pain and degradation it does in no sense limit the possible infliction of pain in the execution of a capital verdict Wrongful execution It is frequently argued that capital punishment leads to miscarriage of justice through the wrongful execution of innocent persons Many people have been proclaimed innocent victims of the death penalty Some have claimed that as many as executions have been carried out in the face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt in the US from through Newly available DNA evidence prevented the pending execution of more than death row inmates during the same period in the US but DNA evidence is only available in a fraction of capital cases As of prisoners on death row have been exonerated by DNA or other evidence which is seen as an indication that innocent prisoners have almost certainly been executed The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty claims that between and prisoners in the United States have been executed while sentenced to death have had their death sentences vacated It is impossible to assess how many have been wrongly executed since courts do not generally investigate the innocence of a dead defendant and defense attorneys tend to concentrate their efforts on clients whose lives can still be saved however there is strong evidence of innocence in many cases Improper procedure may also result in unfair executions For example Amnesty International argues that in Singapore the Misuse of Drugs Act contains a series of presumptions which shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused This conflicts with the universally guaranteed right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty Singapore s Misuse of Drugs Act presumes one is guilty of possession of drugs if as examples one is found to be present or escaping from a location proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug if one is in possession of a key to a premises where drugs are present if one is in the company of another person found to be in possession of illegal drugs or if one tests positive after being given a mandatory urine drug screening Urine drug screenings can be given at the discretion of police without requiring a search warrant The onus is on the accused in all of the above situations to prove that they were not in possession of or consumed illegal drugs Volunteers Some prisoners have volunteered or attempted to expedite capital punishment often by waiving all appeals Prisoners have made requests or committed further crimes in prison as well In the United States execution volunteers constitute approximately of prisoners on death row Volunteers often bypass legal procedures which are designed to designate the death penalty for the worst of the worst offenders Opponents of execution volunteering cited the prevalence of mental illness among volunteers comparing it to suicide Execution volunteers have received considerably less attention and effort at legal reform than those who were exonerated after execution Racial ethnic and social class bias Opponents of the death penalty argue that this punishment is being used more often against perpetrators from racial and ethnic minorities and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds than against those criminals who come from a privileged background and that the background of the victim also influences the outcome Researchers have shown that white Americans are more likely to support the death penalty when told that it is mostly applied to black Americans and that more stereotypically black looking or dark skinned defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death if the case involves a white victim However a study published in failed to replicate the findings of earlier studies that had concluded that white Americans are more likely to support the death penalty if informed that it is largely applied to black Americans according to the authors their findings may result from changes since in the effects of racial stimuli on white attitudes about the death penalty or their willingness to express those attitudes in a survey context In Alabama in a death row inmate named Domineque Ray was denied his imam in the room during his execution instead only offered a Christian chaplain After filing a complaint a federal court of appeals ruled against Ray s request The majority cited the last minute nature of the request and the dissent stated that the treatment went against the core principle of denominational neutrality In July two Shiite men Ali Hakim al Arab and Ahmad al Malali were executed in Bahrain despite the protests from the United Nations and rights group Amnesty International stated that the executions were being carried out on confessions of terrorism crimes that were obtained through torture On March despite the appeals by the United Nations and rights activists year old Malay Singaporean Abdul Kahar Othman was hanged at Singapore s Changi Prison for illegally trafficking diamorphine which marked the first execution in Singapore since as a result of an informal moratorium caused by the COVID pandemic Earlier there were appeals made to advocate for Abdul Kahar s death penalty be commuted to life imprisonment on humanitarian grounds as Abdul Kahar came from a poor family and has struggled with drug addiction He was also revealed to have been spending most of his life going in and out of prison including a ten year sentence of preventive detention from to and has not been given much time for rehabilitation which made the activists and groups arguing that Abdul Kahar should be given a chance for rehabilitation instead of subjecting him to execution Both the European Union EU and Amnesty International criticised Singapore for finalizing and carrying out Abdul Kahar s execution and about Singaporeans protested against the government s use of the death penalty merely days after Abdul Kahar s death sentence was authorised Still over of the public supported the use of the death penalty in Singapore International views The United Nations introduced a resolution during the General Assembly s nd sessions in calling for a universal ban The approval of a draft resolution by the Assembly s third committee which deals with human rights issues voted to with abstentions in favour of the resolution on November and was put to a vote in the Assembly on December Again in a large majority of states from all regions adopted on November in the UN General Assembly Third Committee a second resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty countries voted in favour of the draft resolution voted against and abstained The moratorium resolution has been presented for a vote each year since On December countries voted in favor of the moratorium with countries opposing and abstentions The countries voting against the moratorium included the United States People s Republic of China North Korea and Iran A range of amendments proposed by a small minority of pro death penalty countries were overwhelmingly defeated It had in passed a non binding resolution by to with abstentions by asking its member states for a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty A number of regional conventions prohibit the death penalty most notably the Protocol abolition in time of peace and Protocol abolition in all circumstances to the European Convention on Human Rights The same is also stated under Protocol in the American Convention on Human Rights which however has not been ratified by all countries in the Americas most notably Canada and the United States Most relevant operative international treaties do not require its prohibition for cases of serious crime most notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights This instead has in common with several other treaties an optional protocol prohibiting capital punishment and promoting its wider abolition Several international organizations have made abolition of the death penalty during time of peace or in all circumstances a requirement of membership most notably the EU and the Council of Europe The Council of Europe are willing to accept a moratorium as an interim measure Thus while Russia was a member of the Council of Europe and the death penalty remains codified in its law it has not made use of it since becoming a member of the council Russia has not executed anyone since With the exception of Russia abolitionist in practice and Belarus retentionist all European countries are classified as abolitionist Latvia abolished de jure the death penalty for war crimes in becoming the last EU member to do so Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights calls for the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances including for war crimes The majority of European countries have signed and ratified it Some European countries have not done this but all of them except Belarus have now abolished the death penalty in all circumstances de jure and Russia de facto Poland is the most recent country to ratify the protocol on August Protocol which prohibits the death penalty during peacetime has been ratified by all members of the Council of Europe It had been signed but not ratified by Russia at the time of its expulsion in There are also other international abolitionist instruments such as the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which has parties and the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty for the Americas ratified by states In Turkey over people were sentenced to death after the Turkish coup d tat About of them were executed the last one October Then there was a de facto moratorium on the death penalty in Turkey As a move towards EU membership Turkey made some legal changes The death penalty was removed from peacetime law by the National Assembly in August and in May Turkey amended its constitution to remove capital punishment in all circumstances It ratified Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights in February As a result Europe is a continent free of the death penalty in practice all states having ratified Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights with the exceptions of Russia which has entered a moratorium and Belarus which are not members of the Council of Europe The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has been lobbying for Council of Europe observer states who practice the death penalty the U S and Japan to abolish it or lose their observer status In addition to banning capital punishment for EU member states the EU has also banned detainee transfers in cases where the receiving party may seek the death penalty Sub Saharan African countries that have recently abolished the death penalty include Burundi which abolished the death penalty for all crimes in and Gabon which did the same in On July Benin became part of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ICCPR which prohibits the use of the death penalty The newly created South Sudan is among the UN member states that supported the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly that called for the removal of the death penalty therefore affirming its opposition to the practice South Sudan however has not yet abolished the death penalty and stated that it must first amend its Constitution and until that happens it will continue to use the death penalty Among non governmental organizations NGOs Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are noted for their opposition to capital punishment A number of such NGOs as well as trade unions local councils and bar associations formed a World Coalition Against the Death Penalty in An open letter led by Danish Member of the European Parliament Karen Melchior was sent to the European Commission ahead of the January meeting of the Bahraini Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani with the members of the European Union for the signing of a Cooperation Agreement A total of MEPs undersigned the letter expressing their grave concern towards the extended abuse of human rights in Bahrain following the arbitrary arrest and detention of activists and critics of the government The attendees of the meeting were requested to demand from their Bahraini counterparts to take into consideration the concerns raised by the MEPs particularly for the release of Abdulhadi Al Khawaja and Sheikh Mohammed Habib Al Muqdad the two European Bahraini dual citizens on death row Religious views The world s major faiths have differing views depending on the religion denomination sect and the individual adherent The Catholic Church considers the death penalty as inadmissible in any circumstance and denounces it an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person Both the Bah and Islamic faiths support capital punishment See also Death in custody Execution chamber Executioner Judicial dissolution sometimes referred to as
