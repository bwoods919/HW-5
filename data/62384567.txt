isolation Heavy attributes the title to be a reference to Ernest Hemingway s The Old Man and the Sea in which an old man waning in his abilities struggles to catch a giant marlin The episode also introduces the chemical Globafin which taps into a person s brain and creates a Matrix like simulation of that person s ideal heaven In an analysis by IGN s Jesse Schedeen he wrote that Jerry s

broadcast by Adult Swim on November According to Nielsen Media Research The Old Man and the Seat was seen by million household viewers in the United States and received a rating among the adult demographic making it the lowest rated episode of the series excluding the unannounced season premiere since season s Something Ricked This Way Comes Critical response The A V Club s Zack Handlen gave the episode a B rating writing that while the end result is pretty funny and thematically coherent he also felt it as just slightly under done Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A rating Steve Greene of IndieWire gave it a B rating and described it as the equivalent of a mild inconvenience remarking that reinforcing some old ideas Rick s quest for ultimate privacy and a globe enslaving dating app are a flimsy foundation for a repetitive episode Vulture s Liz Shannon Miller gave it a three out of five star rating and wrote that From the simplest of setups comes once again a Rick and Morty adventure that simultaneously goes completely haywire even while it exposes the innermost pathos of its characters Reviewing for Den of Geek Joe Matar praised the extraordinary parings of Beth and Summer Jerry and Morty and Rick alone with himself as going mostly extremely well Ray Flook of Bleeding Cool described its concept as combining of the emotional gut punch of the ending to the second season episode Auto Erotic Assimilation with the chainsaw slicing social satire found in Rick Potion No and any of the Interdimensional Cable segments References External links The Old Man and
