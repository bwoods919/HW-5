their feelings before testing the vat s acidity Morty eventually grows impatient revealing the ruse and forcing Rick to kill the gangsters Morty insists the vat of acid was a bad idea and harangues Rick over never taking any of his own ideas seriously He goads Rick into creating a portable save point button that one could return to escape death or correct their mistakes Rick relents and crafts a special remote which Morty takes without waiting for an explanation of how it works Morty uses the button to commit numerous crimes and pranks resetting himself each time to avoid any consequences Eventually though he begins a relationship with a girl Carey falling in love with her When they end up stranded in the mountains after a plane crash Morty considers using the remote but calls for rescue instead since the last save point was right before they met However after they are rescued Jerry unintentionally activates the remote Morty then fails to recreate the relationship and accidentally overwrites the save point Morty concedes to Rick that he has learned the hard lesson that consequences determine who a person becomes and give a person s choices meaning A self satisfied Rick then reveals that the remote does not reset anything but instead teleports Morty to an alternate dimension killing the Morty native to that dimension so that Morty can take his place Horrified Morty begs Rick to undo everything Rick merges all of the alternate dimensions causing Morty intense torment While this undoes the deaths of the alternate Mortys all the people in those dimensions who knew about Morty s crimes are now in that merged dimension and descend as an angry mob upon Rick and Morty s house demanding his surrender Rick provides only one escape jumping into a vat of fake acid

Broadcast and ratings The episode was broadcast by Adult Swim on May According to Nielsen Media Research The Vat of Acid Episode was seen by million household viewers in the United States and received a rating among the adult demographic Critical response Jesse Schedeen of IGN awarded the episode with stars out of saying that the episode is a demented romp that showcases Rick Sanchez at his darkest and most hilarious Steve Greene of IndieWire gave it a B rating who felt that even as it s stuck between an unexpected event episode and a decent spite driven adventure there are still enough existential ideas here to chew on Tom Reimann of Collider gave it a B rating who felt that series co creator Dan Harmon has run into some controversy on social media and this ending coupled with Rick s scorched earth take no responsibility response to Morty s criticism casts the episode in a particularly cynical light that makes it difficult to fully enjoy We re three episodes into The Other Five and so far each one has been at least in part a rant about how hard it is to write Rick and Morty I hope the next two episodes manage to fully embrace the smart sci fi deconstruction that made the show so unique in the first place The episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program the series second win after Pickle Rick Music The montage in which Morty is shown using the reset button is set to the song It s in the Way That You Use It by Eric Clapton and Robbie Robertson References External links The Vat of Acid Episode at IMDb
