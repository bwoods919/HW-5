Rick and Morty is an American animated science fiction comedy franchise owned by Warner Bros Discovery whose eponymous duo consists of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith Rick and Morty were created by cartoonist Justin Roiland for a parody film of Back to the Future for Channel a short film festival co founded by Dan Harmon After six years the sketch was developed into Rick and Morty a half hour prime time show that was a hit for Adult Swim receiving universal acclaim across all seasons Alongside the original television series the characters of the show have been featured in a variety of media including spin offs comic books musical releases and video games The show has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in income across their merchandising and media franchise The series centers on the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures with the characters traveling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick s flying car Different versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the show s multiverse and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another The Rick and Morty franchise has received widespread critical acclaim winning two Annie and Emmy Awards Background Creation Justin Roiland conceived of the idea for Rick and Morty as an evolution of his short film parody series The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti inspired by Back to the Future and Scud The Disposable Assassin the latter series of which future Rick and Morty co creator Dan Harmon had written for Themes Dan Harmon has described Rick and Morty as a never ending fart joke wrapped around a studied look into nihilism The formula of the series consists of juxtapositioning two conflicting scenarios an extremely selfish alcoholic grandfather dragging his grandson along for interdimensional adventures intercut with domestic family drama while addressing the insignificance of human existence as compared to the size of the universe with no recognizable divine presence as described by H P Lovecraft s philosophy of cosmicism The characters of the series deal with existential dread and cosmic horror either by asserting the utility of science over magic or by choosing a life in ignorant bliss However as Joachim Heijndermans of Geeks notes none of the characters appear able to handle the absurd and chaotic nature of the universe as Jerry gets by through denial while Rick is a depressed substance addicted suicidal mess Harmon describes the titular Rick Sanchez as a self interested anarchist who doesn t like being told what to do He believes that the character s life on a larger scale has caused him mental illness and opines that the knowledge that nothing matters while accurate gets you nowhere Matthew Bulger of The Humanist noted that the creators of the series were trying to communicate the message that we need to focus on human relationships and not preoccupy our minds with unanswerable questions in order to find a sense of purpose and live a better life Eric Armstrong of The New Republic notes that Morty represents the audience as he is mostly there to react to Rick s deranged schemes The character is transformed by the truths he discovers during his interdimensional adventures with his grandfather However instead of sinking into depression Morty accepts these truths that empower him to value his own life Occasionally characters will acknowledge an episode s narrative or hint at the presence of a fourth wall suggesting that they are aware of the fact that they are characters of a television series Thereunder Troy Patterson of The New Yorker notes that Rick and Morty supplies an artful answer to the question of what follows postmodernism a decadent regurgitation of all its tropes all at once leavened by some humanistic wistfulness Sean Sebastian of Junkee says that the show can be both hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time as it excels at the intersection between big ideas flippancy and wit Main characters The main characters of the show are the members of the Smith household which consists of parents Jerry and Beth and Space Beth their children Summer and Morty and Beth s father Rick Sanchez who lives with them as a guest According to Justin Roiland the family lives outside of Seattle Washington Richard Rick Sanchez voiced by Justin Roiland is a sociopathic nihilistic narcissistic self centered alcoholic mad scientist who is the father of Beth Smith and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer Roiland considers his voice for Rick to be a horrible Doc Brown manic impression Mortimer Morty Smith Sr voiced by Justin Roiland is Rick s neurotic year old grandson son of Jerry and Beth Smith and younger brother of Summer Smith who is frequently dragged into Rick s misadventures One of Morty s interdimensional counterparts President Morty Smith nicknamed Evil Morty by fans and the media serves as the main antagonist of the series Roiland considers his initial voice for Morty to be a horrible Marty McFly impression Gerald Jerry Smith voiced by Chris Parnell is Summer s and Morty s insecure year old father Beth s husband and Rick s son in law who strongly disapproves of Rick s influence over his family Summer Smith voiced by Spencer Grammer is Morty s year old after season older sister a more conventional and often superficial teenager who is obsessed with improving her status among her peers Summer is generally similar to her mother as she is often shown to be very smart and humorous but she has also shown elements of Jerry s approval seeking Bethany Beth Smith n e Sanchez voiced by Sarah Chalke is Rick s daughter Summer and Morty s mother and Jerry s wife She is the most assertive force in her household while also displaying traits of selfishness humor and intelligence Beth is unperturbed by her father s destructive and dangerous tendencies around her son She from childhood views Rick more favorably than her mother due to the parental separation Harmon expanded upon this origin in an interview Kids can sometimes idolize their worst parent and blame their supportive parent for chasing off the dad with the guts to leave She believes that Rick as crazy as he is is the better of her two parents even though she was raised by her mother and she blames her mother s unremarkability on her father s departure and will do anything to keep her father back in her life In The ABC s of Beth it is revealed that Beth shares the same sociopathic tendencies as her father Rick offers to make Beth a clone of herself to tend to her family while she can explore the multiverse In Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri it is revealed that Rick did indeed make a clone of Beth as there is another Space Beth fighting a new and improved version of the Galactic Federation having usurped Rick as the Most Wanted in the galaxy However Rick erased his memory so that he does not remember which Beth is the original and which is the clone which results in both Beths not caring about the truth or about Rick Chalke praised the really interesting dynamic between the characters expressing interest in future seasons of the series depicting all of the things she used to do as a child like force Rick to make her mind control hair clips so people would like her Just seeing her behave so much like Rick at such a young age would be really fun Television series Doc and Mharti shorts on Channel Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon first met at the latter s Los Angeles based non profit monthly short film festival Channel at which participants submit a short film in the format of a pilot and a live audience decides which pilots continue as series Roiland then a producer on reality programming began submitting shock value sick and twisted pilots to the festival a year after its launch in eliciting confused reactions from the audience to which Harmon took a liking leading to the two beginning an ongoing collaboration In following the cancellation of Roiland s House of Cosbys a series he regarded as intensely creatively stifling Roiland funneled his creative energies into creating a web series for Channel The result was The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti an animated short starring parodies of Doc Brown and Marty McFly characters from the Back to the Future film trilogy while promoting Harmon s run on Scud The Disposable Assassin Harmon would later dub the shorts a bastardization a pornographic vandalization of what Rick and Morty would ultimately represent despite their positive critical reception Roiland who voiced the title characters in Doc and Mharti would later reprise his roles in Rick and Morty Rick and Morty present In Harmon was briefly fired from his NBC sitcom Community The Adult Swim network searching for a more prime time hit show approached Harmon shortly afterward who initially viewed the channel as unfit for his style citing his unfamiliarity with animation and his process for creating television focusing more heavily on dialogue characters and story than popular animated series of the time Instead Harmon phoned Roiland to inquire if he had any ideas for an animated series to which Roiland proposed a series focused on the Doc and Mharti characters ultimately renamed Rick and Morty Roiland initially wanted the show s run time to consist of one eleven minute segment but Adult Swim pushed for a half hour program Harmon felt the best way to extend the voices into a program would be to build a family around the characters to which decision Adult Swim development executive Nick Weidenfeld suggested that Rick be made to be Morty s grandfather Having pitched multiple television programs that did not get off the ground Roiland was initially very unreceptive to others attempting to give notes on his pitch Prior to developing Rick and Morty he had created three failed animated pilots for Fox and he had begun to feel burned out with developing television The first draft of the series pilot was completed in six hours on the Paramount Pictures lot in Dan Harmon s unfurnished Community office The duo had broken the story that day sold the pilot and then sat down to write Roiland while acknowledging a tendency for procrastination encouraged Harmon to stay and write the entire first draft We were sitting on the floor cross legged with laptops and I was about to get up and go home and he said Wait if you go home it might take us three months to write this thing Stay here right now and we can write it in six hours He just had a premonition about that recalled Harmon Adult Swim was initially unsure of Roiland doing both voices partially due to the undeveloped nature of the character of Morty Harmon wrote four short premises in which Morty took a more assertive role and sent it to Mike Lazzo Adult Swim subsequently placed a tamer TV rating on the program which initially was met with reluctance from the show s staff The network s reason behind the rating was that it would soon begin broadcasting in prime time competing with major programs Harmon described the series as a cross between Matt Groening s two shows The Simpsons and Futurama balancing family life with heavy science fiction Harmon has stated that his inspiration behind much of the concept and humor for the series comes from various British television series such as The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and Doctor Who He figures that the audience will only understand developments from Morty s point of view but stated we don t want to be the companions We want to hang out with the Doctor we idolize the Doctor but we don t think like him and that s really interesting Rick and Morty has received universal acclaim holding an approval rating of on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes for the entire series While later seasons would focus on the wider Smith family Rick was the lead character in most of the first two seasons In July following the conclusion of the fourth season it was revealed that
