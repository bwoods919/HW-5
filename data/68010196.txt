Loveness s fifth screenplay for the series An animatic of the cold open was published by Adult Swim in July The episode debuted as the season premiere as initially planned though the writers considered swapping it with the following episode Mortyplicity The episode features Jim Gaffigan as Hoovy Dan Harmon as Mr Nimbus and Kari Wahlgren as Jessica Adult Swim published the episode on YouTube The character Mr Nimbus was conceived for an earlier episode but went unused Loveness called him either the antithesis or purest form of Rick Roiland interpreted that Mr Nimbus is not unique in being Rick s nemesis and that he is not comparable to Rick in levels of power However in contrast to Rick s usual seeming invincibility he is more restrained in this episode and must play by the rules and not do any crazy shit Roiland saw Morty s storyline as more significant it originated from a discarded idea where Morty would accidentally forget a copy of the movie Beverly Hills Cop III in a pocket dimension and would return a few days later to find that years had passed and a society had built itself around the movie He said that it made sense to use a pocket dimension to store wine to age it more quickly Analysis The title takes its name from My Dinner with Andre a dialogue heavy comedy drama film set at a dinner between two friends The Community episode Critical Film Studies was an homage to this film on which Harmon previously worked Kevin Perry of The Independent believed that the title is a misdirect as it leads the audience to expect the episode to focus more on conversation between Rick and Mr Nimbus rather than Morty s wine expedition Joe Matar of Den of Geek said that the episode mirrored the season four premiere Edge of Tomorty Rick Die Rickpeat in not following a cliffhanger from the previous season and featuring a storyline about temporality Jessica and the outcome of romantic failure for Morty Mr Nimbus makes a comment to Rick about Diane who has been implied to be Beth s mother and Rick s former wife in previous episodes Harmon said that Rick s backstory would be further explored in the future Morty is irritated at having to follow Rick s instructions demonstrating his changing character from the more meek portrayal in season one Harmon said of this that Morty is not changing because he s aging but because he s been in the show for so long Reception Rating the episode out of five stars Joe Matar of Den of Geek described the episode as smart and well written but familiar in its conceit of time passing faster inside the pocket dimension Matar praised that the storyline s resolution involving Jessica was funny and insane and gave a lukewarm review of Mr Nimbus saying that he just didn t find Nimbus particularly funny but didn t hate him either David Opie of Digital Spy praised the series premiere saying It s just as inventive as ever and by not resetting the status quo there s more room for character development The Independent s Kevin Perry praised the choice to center Morty in the episode as most promising in terms of where the show could now be headed and serving to remind fans why they fell in love with the show in the first place References External links Mort Dinner Rick Andre at IMDb
