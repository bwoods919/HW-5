confirmed that the writing for the tail end of the series third season had occurred during Donald Trump s then ongoing presidential campaign was inspired by the idea of a cartoonishly bad president for the character s appearance in The Rickchurian Mortydate in contrast to their original depiction following how out of control presidential power has gotten by the time the episode aired in October Trump had been elected and serving in the office for almost a year Keith David who voices the character previously voiced a fictionalised version of himself as Vice President of the United States in the video game Saints Row IV and Reverse Giraffe in Total Rickall Reception The character has received positive reception Inverse praised the President s depiction in The Rickchurian Mortydate as a petulant manbaby who can t take criticism or disobedience and Donald Trump stand in compared to his Get Schwifty depiction describing the character s final fight with Rick Sanchez as the single greatest action sequence in Rick and Morty history Vulture described the character as feel ing anachronistic with IndieWire complimenting it mak ing sense that the main issue powering this President Rick feud is that each of them think they re too good at their job and describing interactions with The President as feel ing like a subtle jab at the rest of the TV world before praising how Keith David s vocal performance handling the presidential shame list with the shame joyful enthusiasm as digging into shouting You suck makes him a legend in the show s annals even if The President has only popped up twice Reason lauded the political commentary of the character and the concepts of imperial presidency and how out of control presidential power has gotten commenting on how the series decision not to model its president on any specific real life equivalent avoids being a commentary on any one specific officeholder and instead becomes a stinging commentary on the office itself while Screen Rant described the President as a welcome addition as a great antagonist for Rick and sometimes ally expressing hope that their rivalry and back and forth will continue to be expanded upon throughout the series Contrastingly Variety criticized the President s increased role in the series fifth season stating the Rick and the President messarounds to have never actually been the most interesting or exciting plots of the series although expressing interest in a future appearance by the character exploring a romantic connection between the pair References
