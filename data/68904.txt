alcoholism during the onset of his Parkinson s diagnosis but has been sober since Parkinson s disease Fox started displaying symptoms of early onset Parkinson s disease in while shooting the film Doc Hollywood and was diagnosed shortly thereafter Though his initial symptoms were only a twitching little finger and a sore shoulder he was told that within a few years he would not be able to work The causes of Parkinson s disease are not well understood and may include genetic and environmental factors Fox is one of at least four members of the cast and crew of Leo and Me who developed early onset Parkinson s According to Fox this is not enough people to be defined as a cluster so it has not been well researched He told Hadley Freeman of The Guardian in late I can think of a thousand possible scenarios I used to go fishing in a river near paper mills and eat the salmon I caught I ve been to a lot of farms I smoked a lot of pot in high school when the government was poisoning the crops But you can drive yourself crazy trying to figure it out After his diagnosis Fox began drinking heavily and grew depressed He eventually sought help and stopped drinking altogether He went public with his Parkinson s disease in and has become a strong advocate for Parkinson s disease research His foundation The Michael J Fox Foundation was created to help advance every promising research path to curing Parkinson s disease Since he has led a million effort which is the Foundation s landmark observational study to discover the biological markers of Parkinson s disease with the Parkinson s Progression Markers Initiative PPMI Fox manages the symptoms of his Parkinson s disease with the drug carbidopa levodopa and he had a thalamotomy in His first book Lucky Man focused on how after seven years of denial of the disease he set up the Michael J Fox Foundation stopped drinking and became an advocate for people living with Parkinson s disease In Lucky Man Fox wrote that he did not take his medication prior to his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee in partial C SPAN video clip I had made a deliberate choice to appear before the subcommittee without medication It seemed to me that this occasion demanded that my testimony about the effects of the disease and the urgency we as a community were feeling be seen as well as heard For people who had never observed me in this kind of shape the transformation must have been startling In an interview with NPR in April Fox explained what he does when he becomes symptomatic Well actually I ve been erring on the side of caution I think erring is actually the right word in that I ve been medicating perhaps too much in the sense that the symptoms people see in some of these interviews that I have been on are actually dyskinesia which is a reaction to the medication Because if I were purely symptomatic with Parkinson s symptoms a lot of times speaking is difficult There s a kind of a cluttering of speech and it s very difficult to sit still to sit in one place You know the symptoms are different so I d rather kind of suffer the symptoms of dyskinesia this kind of weaving and this kind of continuous thing is much preferable actually than pure Parkinson s symptoms So that s what I generally do I haven t had any you know problems with pure Parkinson s symptoms in any of these interviews because I ll tend to just make sure that I have enough Sinemet in my system and in some cases too much But to me it s preferable It s not representative of what I m like in my everyday life I get a lot of people with Parkinson s coming up to me saying You take too much medication I say Well you sit across from Larry King and see if you want to tempt it In Fox starred in a campaign ad for then State Auditor of Missouri Claire McCaskill in her successful Senate campaign against incumbent Jim Talent expressing her support for embryonic stem cell research In the ad he visibly showed the effects of his Parkinson s disease As you might know I care deeply about stem cell research In Missouri you can elect Claire McCaskill who shares my hope for cures Unfortunately Senator Jim Talent opposes expanding stem cell research Senator Talent even wanted to criminalize the science that gives us the chance for hope They say all politics is local but that s not always the case What you do in Missouri matters to millions of Americans Americans like me The New York Times called it one of the most powerful and talked about political advertisements in years and polls indicated that the commercial had a measurable impact on the way voters voted in an election that McCaskill won His second book Always Looking Up The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist describes his life between and with much of the book centered on how Fox got into campaigning for stem cell research On March Fox appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show with Mehmet Oz to discuss his condition as well as his book his family and his primetime special which aired May Michael J Fox Adventures of an Incurable Optimist His work led him to be named one of the people whose power talent or moral example is transforming the world in by
