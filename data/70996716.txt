Gatlian Kenny Justin Roiland he reveals to the player that their planet is being invaded by Garmantuous Hal Lublin and the G Cartel which plans to turn the entire human race into drugs To avoid being captured the player and Kenny work together to escape Earth and warps their house to Blim City Needing help to fight the G Kenny tasks the player to find and hire the famous bounty hunter Gene Zaroothian David Herman While they are able to find Gene they discover that he has become a crippled homeless bum Initially not interested in helping out the player character Gene changes his mind when he offers to make the player a bounty hunter in exchange for their house if they die Now known as the Bounty Hunter Gene gives them his old bounty hunter suit and sets up a Bounty in the house before tasking them with retrieving his old knife Knifey Michael Cusack from a G mercenary known as Torg Jennifer Hale The player character is tasked to travel through the Blim City slums in order to find and kill Torg in her hideout within the sewage plant The player encounters members of Torg s gang as they fight their way through learning more about Kenny s capabilities such as an ability known as the glob shot which allows the player to shoot globs of goo at enemies and objects to solve puzzles and deal additional damage Eventually the player finds Torg and defeats her Afterward the player character is tasked with locating and killing the respective leaders of the G including Garmantuous himself in order to liberate Earth from the cartel The first two leaders the player is sent to kill include Douglas Tom Kenny a sadistic torture obsessed pathological liar whom is tasked with training new members of the G and Krubis Echo Kellum a jittery trigger happy addict who is tasked with enslaving a village of the teddy bear like Moplets to mine for Furgles another species harvested to be used as drugs Both Douglas and Krubis have other captured Gatlians in their possession including a rapid fire female Gatlian named Sweezy Betsy Sodaro whose ability to create time bubbles can slow down time for whoever or whatever is trapped inside one and a three shot shotgun based Gatlian named Gus J B Smoove whose ability is to shoot large razer blades that can stick to walls After the player manages to kill both Douglas and Krubis they and Kenny rescue Sweezy and Gus and recruit them to their team With both bounties dead Gene invites the player to watch a news bulletin by Blim City s Magistrate Clugg Nuggin who publicly praises the player s actions in their fight against the G and asks the bounty hunter to join forces with him and Blim City At Gene s recommendation the player accepts the offer and meets up with Clugg in his office where he reveals his knowledge of the player being human and their survival of the G s invasion He asks the player to help him fight the G in exchange for a special device that will help them find and rescue imprisoned humans and teleport them to a safe haven created by Clugg to provide humans sanctuary until the G are stopped As thanks for agreeing to help Clugg has his forces send all vital intelligence on the G to Gene who recommends the player buy a jetpack upgrade for their suit upon returning The upgrade arrives several days later which the player tests by flying across buildings Meanwhile at home Lizzie has been getting into constant arguments with Gene and has also started dating an alien boyfriend name Tweeg who Gene clearly dislikes After helping them determine which one is right during an intense argument Gene informs the player that the intel sent by Clugg is finally paying off with two new bounties One of the two new bounties is the Skrendel Bros who have enslaved the Moplets again for the G and have captured another Gatlian named Creature They also find a scientific analysis on another Gatlian named Lezduit whom Kenny seems to personally recognize Creature Tim Robinson who had been brutally tortured by the G s numerous experiments helps the player escape with his ability to asexually reproduce smaller aliens with microscopic lifespans which they use to sabotage machinery The player then dispatches the Skrendel Bros Jonathan Abed Gheith Angela Ryan Ridley and Mona Roiland who eventually form a tower of each other they name Bro Tron but are all killed by the player After this is done Garmantuous personally contacts the player and warns them that he now has two very important people in his custody which the player and Gatlians all deduce must be the player s parents and taunts the player with the promise that he is going to kill them after making them suffer He also reveals that he has set up a new base on Earth which is inaccessible without the right coordinates After returning home Gene talks to the player about fixing up some old bounty ads to attract more customers and the player meets Lizzie s alien boyfriend Tweeg who they can either allow to keep dating Lizzie or follow Gene s advice and demand that he stop seeing her Regardless this leads to another argument between Gene and Lizzie the latter of which has become increasingly upset with the former living on their couch Lizzie then departs and Gene informs the player that despite their growing list of firepower they re still not ready to face Garmantuous Gene then tells the player that Clugg s data has revealed the existence of an extremely powerful Gatlian in the possession of Dr Jon Giblets Kevin McDonald who the player must find with their suit s utterly useless detective mode After eventually gaining a lead towards a new store called High on Life which is located in the slums the player meets two aliens that threaten them before teleporting away and then steal a pair of magnetic boots off the corpse of an alien accidentally trampled to death by people looking to enter the store The player uses them to escape the slums after suddenly getting attacked and return home to find the same aliens from before now revealed to be Clugg s sons who inform the player that the remains of the Torg family got mixed up with Giblets who they now have a lead on They then take the player back to Clugg who hesitantly asks for help in his upcoming election by getting rid of Giblets Clugg provides them with map data to find Giblets provided that his involvement in the matter stays secret With this new data the player teleports to Giblets lab where they find Giblets had murdered his own G staff to do experiments on them The weapon Giblets used to attack his men turns out to be the previously mentioned Gatlian now revealed to be a famous and powerful Gatlian named Lezduit now catatonic and inoperable due to intense experimentation by Dr Giblets The player recovers them for Gene to examine later and finds Giblets who accidentally slips and falls and therefore kills himself The player then deals with Giblets failsafe security before departing The player returns to Gene and gives Lezduit to him in order to see if he can be salvaged but then Gene informs them that Lizzie has gone missing and is asked to find her Suspecting Tweeg may somehow be involved in her disappearance Gene directs them to the Space Applebee s down in the slums Before departing however Kenny suddenly asks the player to leave all the other Gatlians with Gene clearly nervous about something he wants to tell the player Upon arriving at Applebees Kenny and the player take a seat after failing to find Tweeg and Kenny reveals that he is actually the one who is responsible for the destruction of his home planet Gatlus Kenny explains to the player that Gatlus was once an isolated planet on the far edge of an asteroid belt completely unknown to the wider galaxy just like Earth once was One day an alien smuggler named Rel Delmar crash landed on the planet Kenny wanting to leave the planet due to his people constantly calling him a failure decided to help Rel fix his ship and then go with him finally getting the chance to achieve his dream of seeing outer space and having great adventures Unfortunately Rel being a smuggler caused several run ins with several shady characters and eventually met up with the G and Garmantuous who immediately became fascinated with Kenny s abilities of unlimited firepower and tricked him into revealing the existence of Gatlus Garmantuous led the G in an invasion of the planet but were pushed back in a rebellion led by Lezduit Garmantuous attacked again however with a powerful super virus that zombified most of the Gatlians and a remorseful Kenny told Lezduit of his involvement in the invasion before seemingly dying not knowing that Lezduit would survive Kenny admits he is now scared that he will have to tell the other Gatlians what he did but just as he finishes his story they spot Tweeg and Liz outside Depending on the player s earlier choices this will either be Lizzie running off with Tweeg to start a new life in which the G will have learned about the bounty hunter through Gene s bounty hunting ads or Tweeg would be selling out the player to the G for money and then kidnapping Lizzie for more money Either way they disappear into Tweeg s space RV before the G suddenly attack the player despite being in the neutral Blim City They flee back to the house and teleport away to specific coordinates under Kenny s instructions They end up teleporting to Gatlus now left a toxic wasteland thanks to the G and Kenny warns that if they don t stop the G Earth will end up exactly the same The next day Gene summons everyone to discuss their next move and provides the player extra over shield for their bounty hunting suit Gene reveals that he has tracked Lizzie s bio signal and sends the player to bring her back Depending on the previous choices Lizzie will either break up with Tweeg if their relationship turns out to not be going anywhere or will have outright killed him if he tried to kidnap her Upon returning Clugg sends the team data on Nipulon James Urbaniak one of Garmantuous top lieutenants as well as the promise that Lezduit will be fixed by the time the player gets back Upon hearing this Kenny decides to tell the other Gatlians what he did shunning himself from the rest of the group as they now resent him for causing the destruction of their home and people Despite agreeing to track down and kill Nipulon at his drug lounge the other Gatlians decide to abandon Kenny once the G are dealt with During the hunt for Nipulon Kenny constantly tries to make amends with the others but only Creature seems willing to hear him out After managing to blend in with the G and invade their lounge undercover the player is sent into a fit of violent rage after seeing how the G mistreat the other humans and slaughter their way to Nipulon s office Nipulon fights the player and sends them into a drug induced hallucination during which the player battles and defeats their own personal insecurities and helps the Gatlians reconcile with Kenny allowing them to fight and defeat Nipulon together With Nipulon now dead the player and the Gatlians steal the Earth coordinates off Nipulon s computer and return home where Gene and Lizzie are now less hostile with each other and finally finish repairing Lezduit Mike Stoklasa Despite his speech functions having been limited to only saying his name Lezduit remains otherwise fully functional and joins the player in their fight to reclaim Earth which is now a wasteland similar to Gatlus Before departing however Gene provides the player with one final thing a remote atomizer bomb which can be used on Garmantuous and his hardened skin as a last resort before he and Lizzie warp off planet for their own safety After fighting their way to Garmantuous the player engages him in a final battle and manages to immobilize him long enough to plant the atomizer bomb into his anus Unfortunately the bomb s remote detonator doesn t work and Garmantuous recovers and temporarily captures the player presenting them with the two people he captured now revealed to not actually be the player s parents but Jack Black and Susan Sarandon Upon realizing that the player doesn t actually love either of them Garmantuous kills them both and fights the player again only to be defeated a second time Realizing that there is only one way to finish him off for good Kenny volunteers to let himself be sacrificed by detonating the bomb manually Regardless of whether or not the player chooses Kenny or any other of the Gatlians acquired throughout their journey Garmantuous is blown up and the Gatlian used to kill him survives mostly unscathed saving the planet from the G In the game s secret ending the player visits the human sanctuary and finds a secret room where it turns out Clugg has been secretly experimenting on humans within the sanctuary The player chases Clugg to another secret room occupied by Dr Gurgula who executes Clugg and reveals himself to be the scientist responsible for the virus that zombified Gatlus having believed that Gatlians were the key to some sort of next step in organic evolution but now believes the key to be within humans Gurgula then departs setting up possible sequel bait and the player is confronted by Clugg s sons who claim to have never liked their father and promise to look after the rescued humans better than their father did The player decides to believe them and then leaves Development Development of High on Life began in a short time after the release of the studio s previous title Trover Saves the Universe

Gabourey Sidibe Reception High on Life received mixed or average reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic The game s crude and absurdist humor proved polarizing In a positive review IGN called it an irreverent absurd shooter that manages to shine with its outrageous humor silly setting and story while Eurogamer criticized that the writing too often settles into edgelord cynicism and the same tedious punchdown humour as South Park The Guardian noted that the line between entertaining and excruciating here is down to how you feel about listening to a game length version of Rick and Morty s Interdimensional Cable ad libs Reviewers also noted that the game suffered from a number of technical issues Squanch Games released a day one patch addressing these bugs along with a second patch on December Sales High on Life was the most played title on Xbox Game Pass during the week of its release and was the fourth most played title on the Xbox platform overall and was hailed as a
