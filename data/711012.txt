two being childhood friends the magazine was launched in as the Voice of Montreal with a Quebec welfare grant The intention of the founders was to provide work and a community service When the editors later sought to dissolve their commitments with the original publisher Alix Laurent they bought him out and changed the name to Vice in Richard Szalwinski a Canadian software millionaire acquired the magazine and relocated the operation to New York City in the late s Following the relocation the magazine quickly developed a reputation for provocative and politically incorrect content Under Szalwinski s ownership a few retail stores were opened in New York City and customers could purchase fashion items that were advertised in the magazine However due to the end of the dot com bubble the three founders eventually regained ownership of the Vice brand followed by closure of the stores The British edition of Vice was launched in and Andy Capper was its first editor Capper explained in an interview shortly after the UK debut that the publication s remit was to cover the things we re meant to be ashamed of and articles were published on topics such as bukkake and bodily functions By the end of foreign editions of Vice magazine were published the Vice independent record label was functional and the online video channel VBS com had unique viewers from the U S during the month of August The media company was still based in New York City but the magazine began featuring articles on topics that were considered more serious such as armed conflict in Iraq than previous content Alvi explained to The New York Times in November The world is much bigger than the Lower East Side and the East Village McInnes left the publication in citing creative differences as the primary issue In an email communication dated January McInnes explained I no longer have anything to do with Vice or VBS or DOs DON Ts or any of that It s a long story but we ve all agreed to leave it at creative

bankruptcy The company s lenders Fortress Investment Group Soros Fund Management and Monroe Capital have agreed to purchase the company for million Staff Shane Smith Co Founder Suroosh Alvi Co Founder Ellis Jones Editor in Chief Content Scope Vice magazine includes the work of journalists columnists fiction writers graphic artists and cartoonists and photographers Both Vice s online and magazine content has shifted from dealing mostly with independent arts and pop cultural matters to covering more serious news topics Due to the large array of contributors and the fact that often writers will only submit a small number of articles with the publication Vice s content varies dramatically and its political and cultural stance is often unclear or contradictory Articles on the site feature a range of subjects often things not covered as by mainstream media The magazine s editors have championed the immersionist school of journalism which has been passed to other properties of Vice Media such as the documentary television show Balls Deep on the Viceland Channel This style of journalism is regarded as something of a DIY antithesis to the methods practiced by mainstream news outlets and has published an entire issue of articles written in accordance with this ethos Entire issues of the magazine have also been dedicated to the concerns of Iraqi people Native Americans Russian people people with mental disorders and people with mental disabilities Vice also publishes an annual guide for students in the United Kingdom In a Vice announcement was published on the Internet After umpteen years of putting out what amounted to a reference book every month we started to get bored with it Besides too many other magazines have ripped it and started doing their own lame take on themes So we re going to do some issues starting now that have whatever we feel like putting in them Politics In a March interview with The Guardian Smith was asked about the magazine s political allegiances and he stated We re not trying to say anything politically in a paradigmatic left right way We don t do that because we don t believe in either side Are my politics Democrat or Republican I think both are horrific And it doesn t matter anyway Money runs America money runs everywhere Website Vice founded its website as Viceland com in as Vice com was already owned In it started VBS tv as a domain which prioritized videos over print and had a number of shows for free such as The Vice Guide to Travel In Viceland com and VBS tv were combined into Vice com also the host of the Vice

provocation In Vice was described as gonzo journalism for the YouTube generation As the magazine grew into a broader media brand it struggled with how to distance itself from its crude past yet hold on to enough of that reputation to cement and grow its authority with its core audience Nevertheless the magazine has continued to face controversy In the magazine retracted parts of a fashion spread

he evaded authorities to avoid being questioned about a murder case Sexual harassment at parent company In the autumn of multiple stories were published citing allegations of sexual misconduct and a
