will Rick finally be rewarded what is rightfully his this year s Prom King crown and sash Development In February Mildred Louis described her work on colouring Sarah Graley s art on Lil Poopy Superstar as doing a really great job of capturing a lot of the punch from the Rick and Morty cartoon while still maintaining a good amount of influence from their own work while having a really nice playful quality to it Graley herself further revealed that she was initially approached by Oni Press editor Ari Yarwood who described the series as charming and fun to pitch a standalone issue of the first Rick and Morty ongoing comic book series which ultimately turned into an order for a five issue spin off miniseries with the potential to become an ongoing series itself Describing Rick and Morty as having been one of her favourite cartoons and working on the series as feeling like writing drawing fan fiction but as my job Asked on the process of taking a one off and more or less undefined character and turning him into the focal point of a story Graley elaborated that it gave her a lot of creative freedom and that I started brainstorming ideas when I realized I could really dig into this and get creative defining Summer Smith as quick witted one who takes control and doesn t take any BS and Mr Poopybutthole as eccentric and maybe a loose cannon with both having good intentions and strong moral compasses which lead them on this adventure to right a wrong in Mr Poopybutthole s mysterious past On developing her own artistic style for the series Graley stated that she wanted the comic to still reflect the show artistically while allowing her own style to be present citing a love for picking up comics where the style breaks the mould and reflects the particular artist s own personal touch specifically citing issues of the mainline series by Zac Gorman and Kyle Starks On writing Mr Poopybutthole s dialogue and its rhythm Graley described it as a little weird to start with as there wasn t much dialogue as reference to work from Mr Poopybutthole has such unique vocabulary though so what I had to work with was plenty in regards to getting the voice right in the comic Ooo wees totally snuck into my own vocabulary for a little while though I bet I was a total treat to hang out with because of that Graley described the various backup stories as little peeks into what the rest of the Smith family were up to while Summer and Mr Poopybutthole were off adventuring and super fun to play around with the other characters in particular her favorite character Jerry Smith before concluding the overall process to have been a total blast The series variant covers were illustrated by Megan Levens Cat Farris Sara Richard Katy Farina Alice Meichi Li Molly Ostertag Emilee Denich and Julieta Col s In a separate interview in April responding to Katy Farina s statement of writing the series allowing a lot of freedom to experiment with colors and light sources in all these alien worlds so I get to mess around a bunch Sarah Graley further described the writing of Lil Poopy Superstar in allowing playing around with other people s characters as pretty amazing and drawing artwork that would later be coloured by Mildred Louis as a really cool part of working on Lil Poopy Superstar because she s always knocking it outta the park concluding that it was exciting working on a team submitting all your parts separately and then later seeing everything finished coming together to form each awesome issue Reception David Brooke of AIPT Comics lauded Sarah Graley s writing and illustrations as bringing a unique art style that s reminiscent of Bryan Lee O Malley and a lot of the same energy as her series Pizza Witch which a series like this needs describing the series antagonists as some kind of amalgam of Sesame Street and Meatball from Aqua Teen Hunger Force before concluding to compliment the special effects around the title character that add a bit of oomph to the character and describe the series as a must read for die hard Rick and Morty fans Denis Varkov of Kanobu complimented Lil Poopy Superstar as the first mini series in the franchise as a simple as possible story worth paying attention to while Paul Mirek of Broken Frontier simply summed up the series as unsummarizable Comic Bastards praised the quirkiness as strong embracing the crazy sci fi parody goodness of the franchise noting that this comic seems to be made for existing fans of the show but it would be better if this comic was accessible to those who aren t already familiar with the source material satirical and even thought provoking at times despite all its obvious wacky craziness The Bookish Kirra complimented Sarah Graley s illustrations as pretty great with the same look of the show but with a rounder and quicker drawing style with a lot of effort put into the drawing in depth and detailed background settings and her writing as very similar to the show with a good amount of it to keep the story flowing quickly while Adam Frey of Pop Culture Uncovered praised Graley s hyperbolic take on the characters criticising her art as neither replicating the show s distinct style nor making its own unique take on the characters In the series was nominated for the Licensed Comic of the Year and Best New Comic Book Series at the Diamond Gem
