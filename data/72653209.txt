Farina would see cut to the bleak truth of what Pok mon actually means and be released July after a free preview would be included in the Free Comic Book Day issue of Rick and Morty on May Described as having cinematic art with every shot being full of hilarious background Mortys inspired by Where s Wally in excess of an issue and named in reference to the Gary Clark song Drive It Like You Stole It from the soundtrack of the Irish coming of age comedy drama film Sing Street the series follows the evolution of a plain ol Morty from our Pikachu into President Evil Morty the perennial antagonist of the first five seasons of the Rick and Morty television series fight ing in the name of his Mortimer brethren with each individual issue containing trading cards inspired by Magic The Gathering Reception Keenan McClelland of Geek com complimented the whole theme of the series as feel ing as if the world of Pok mon joined forces with Battle Royal e with the jokes in PLYSI being just as funny as the ones in the television series and at times more so and the interactions also feel ing genuine and right out of the show in particular complimenting Howard s fantastic job in beautifully convey ing the characters for who they are in writing and Ellerby s and Farina art style as being as solid as ever all about laying low from the hunter as if they re retelling a bad installment from The Hunger Games Patrick Hayes of SciFiPulse Net similarly lauded the series calling it a nice twist on the beloved videogame trading card franchise with art as good as the series with plenty of quick visual jokes Jesse Schedeen of IGN similarly described the series as an enjoyable addition to Oni s growing Rick and Morty library with the series captur ing the look feel and general sense of humor of the show while also offering a different perspective on the mobile gaming source material Pocket Mortys providing a goofy but bleak little misadventure that feels worthy of the source material basically Lord of the Flies mixed with the bizarre nihilistic sense of humor the show is known for instead of attempt ing a straightforward adaptation of the game in particular praising the characterisation of the series main Morty as an amusing protagonist one who s laughably pathetic yet rendered just well enough that the reader can t help but root for him with the most interesting aspect of this series being the way that Rick is painted as such an overt villain Denis Varkov of Kanobu praised the series writing for subverting expectations of a comic based on a game based on a TV series in always find ing a way to surprise you complimenting Marc Ellerby s art as the best of the artists of the main series whose style is deliberately close to what is seen in the television series Robbie Pleasant of Multiversity Comics meanwhile complimented the evolution of Plain Morty to Evil Morty and his violent outbreak against the original Council of Ricks a s a nice callback to the occasional outbursts the show has given Morty Prime that it s clear that Tini Howard watched the show more than enough to get the little details and drives behind the characters and their multiple multiversal variants of most of the characters whom Howard gives l ittle differences that help them stand apart further praising the art of Marc Ellerby as manag ing to capture the character designs and overall look of the show in comic form nicely with Katy Farina s color work providing a bright appropriately cartoon like look to the comic with their collectively being some nice moments where the art really adds an impact to the story really com ing together to create amusing moments Pleasant further complimented the series ending as the perfect note to end the comic on very true to the tone and philosophy of the series although feeling that overall it doesn t reach the full potential that a Pocket Mortys story could be Rebecca Henley of WomenWriteAboutComics comparatively compared the series to writer Tini Howard s previous miniseries Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Pink from Boom Studios with both series really indulged a fan s need to just see the characters do cool stuff Further Henley expanded that loath as I am to be a reviewer swayed by references I love how this comic decided that if putting Mortys in Pok mon were fun seeing them in other caretaking games must be equally fun Mortys in Neko Atsume Mortys in Farmville and a hand held Tamagotchi praising artist Marc Ellerby s big eyed colorful Mortys and colorist Katy Farina for mak ing the art pop while having enough desaturation not to seem overly cute concluding the series to be an entertaining graphic novel that plays around with the concept of the video game Pocket Mortys without just replicating it and has a lot of cool riffs on other mobile casual games just on the side of Rick and Morty s sick sense of humor without getting too bleak with art that is unique but works for the series A Corentin of Just Focus praised the visual humor and very funny situations of the series and how the authors manage d to make the reader laugh on every page and embracing the atmosphere of the Rick and Morty television series Collected editions References External links Rick and Morty Pocket Like You Stole It at Oni Press
