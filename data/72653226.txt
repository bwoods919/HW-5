shocking conclusion to Rick and Morty Go to Hell Development While Oni Press original contract to publish an ongoing comic book series based on the animated series Rick and Morty expired after five years with the publication of the final issue of The Rickoning in March announced as the conclusion of the series and brand as a whole Oni Press signed a new contract for a succession of limited run series from different writer illustrator teams beginning with Rick and Morty Go to Hell an epilogue series to The Rickoning following its alternate reality Rick Morty and Smith family as they find themselves in Hell following their deaths and the destruction of their universe at the end of The Rickoning Announced in January to be written by Ryan Ferrier and illustrated by Constanza Oroza with a premise of Dante s Inferno meets Office Space Ferrier described the series as some of the best comedy I ve ever written And I ve always had a propensity for writing comedy and especially satire I think it s really fun to bring a ridiculous amount of laughs to the realm of fire and brimstone further elaborating on wreak ing havoc in the Rick and Morty sandbox as a total thrill describing his collaboration with Oroza as forming a phenomenal equally twisted team to make weird irreverent and most importantly funny comics finally summarising the affair as Mad science fiction and devil business are two of my favorite things and we re taking extreme joy in throwing these characters into the figurative and literal fires Rick and Morty are going to Hell and we re taking you down with us To promote the series two different covers drawn by Brian Smith were made available along with an insane variant cover limited to copies by Z Burnay made available through Oni s website in the Exclusive Editions section of their store Reception Comics XF lauded the overall narrative of Go to Hell for only get ting sharper and more interesting as Rick and Morty trawl Hell s depths in particular bringing attention to the remarkable thing from a storytelling standpoint in that all of the characters except Beth have something to do in Rick and Morty both mak ing some emotional breakthroughs as they react to their various tortures Jerry tr ying to rally the denizens of the underworld against Rick and Summer learn ing that courtship is hell everywhere especially in Hell concluding to say the narrative depth of the series stacks up nicely to any of the show s episodes and is right there with the best of Kyle Starks run the apex of A Tale of Two Jerries Aaron Phillips of But Why Tho praised the dialogue heavy rip roaring existential debate had by Rick and Morty while they traverse the rocky terrain of the afterlife with writer Ryan Ferrier having done justice to the opening issue in the series by laying the foundations for the plot by having Rick and Morty essentially on opposite ends of the spectrum as they tackle this abstract concept The joy of the story is in the intelligence of the discussion between the two characters Morty serv ing as a good narrative instrument for the visuals we see in the panels and Ferrier really test ing the limits of Rick s rationality throughout the issue by throwing obstacle after obstacle but then counteracts it with a level of reasoning mixed with a level of disdain at the mere mortals that surround him that would definitely come from someone with the intellect of Rick Sanchez in addition to praising the consistency of Oroza s artwork and Stern s coloring Tanner Dedmon of ComicBook com similarly complimented the series as a pretty generic Rick and Morty adventure with a perfect use of the Rick and Morty formula Lucas Fashina of Comic Crusaders lauded Go to Hell s continuation of the television series themes of Rick Sanchez s conflicting views on the existence of God alternating from openly expressing atheism to recognising but not respecting the existence of God and the Devil not respecting either but nonetheless fearing death and the conflicting options of an abyss over Hell describing the character s initial denial of his damnation as puzzling praising Constanza Oroza s pretty good art style while expressing disappointment at a general lack of Easter Eggs while Jody Cardona of Monkeys Fighting Robots praised Oroza s fantastic job of capturing the feel of the original series while adding extra details On the resolution of the fifth and final issue of Go to Hell wrap ping up with a bang Jesse Bereta of Bubbleblabber called it the stand out piece of the series If one were to skip the rest of the books and just read this conclusion it would be better and likely still make sense deserv ing the recognition of being a good read on its own Elvie Mae Parian of WomenWriteAboutComics criticised the series as being pretty run of the mill when it comes to any other Rick and Morty story in spite of its fiery premise describing Constanza Oroza s art as spot on perfectly translating the animated series house style in this comic form with a looser interpretation that is mostly accurate to our familiarity with this cartoon cast Sometimes slightly off model but in a way that is intentionally dynamic to add freneticism to the still images while comparatively complimenting it in comparison to writer Ryan Ferrier s previous work on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Universe and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Stephen Schleicher and Robert Mammone similarly described the series as being as competently done as The Simpsons Comics praising Ferrier as having the characters down pat Their dialogue their reactions all fit ting with what we ve seen in the series in particular an astonishing juxtaposition of Morty Smith s self involved lament with a moment of true mourning among stand out laugh lines in a rendition of Amazing Grace positively compared to former U S President Barack Obama while complimenting Oroza s artwork as evok ing the series very well with the only gripe of that if you re going to set a story in Hell make the surroundings more hellish concluding to state Go to Hell to have been a decent stab at transferring the television characters to the printed page with the writing more or less match ing the tone of the show Collected editions References External links Rick and Morty Go to Hell at Oni Press
