and the dragons are on the hunt for the mythical Dragon Toys Part Four As Rick and Fascist Teddy Bear Rick reluctantly unite against their creations Leonard gets a very special title from the dragons Development Announced in October for a February premiere given free reign by Oni Press to write a sequel to any Rick and Morty episode of his choosing Josh Trujillo stated that the moment he saw Balthromaw and his sensual dragon warriors in Jeff Loveness fourth season episode Claw and Hoarder Special Ricktim s Morty that he knew exactly what story he wanted to tell describing the miniseries as something that lives up the comedy and insanity of the animated series with the kinkiest team of super villains to ever grace a comic book page Series artist Jarrett Williams considered the series the best project to have done during quarantine with some really ambitious comic layouts while supporting artist Tony Fleecs described the premise of the series as a whole as I love when licensed comics take characters you saw for a SPLIT second in a show or movie and then tell a giant story about just that one character and when tiny characters get to have a whole life outside of the show We re doing that in this book with not one but TWO beloved featured extras and also there s just a ton of super horny dragons Reception Reviewing the series Gizmodo complimented the grounded sort of reunion between Grampa Leonard and the Smith family that nonetheless brings out the worst in both Rick and Morty while Bubbleblabbber described the series as one of the best miniseries spin offs of the franchise in some time with its utilization of known characters intermixed in a pair of new plots pleasing fans old and new alike while satisfying ly pack ing the pages full of exciting concepts and actions and the underl ying familial relationships manag ing to tie this whole miniseries together Morty needed to spend the one on one time with his other grandfather to discover his value While Rick needed to come to terms with his emotions in his own way So while their adventures were literally worlds apart the goal for both was the same they each needed to overcome their apprehension with Leonard concluding that The wars with dragons soul swallowers fascist teddy bears and pocket universes were all built around a solid emotional tale The epic adventures kept us entertained but were nothing more than vessels for a story much more grounded It helps to separate this miniseries from many of the other Rick and Morty comic books available It found and mended a hole from the original series that may never be touched upon And the focus was on telling this story in a universe of science fiction and fantasy instead of shoehorning it in If more comic adaptations of televised sitcoms put this amount of thought and effort into them they wouldn t be disappearing at the rate they have been these past few years Worlds Apart managed to pick out some highlights from the franchise while adding some great insights and new directions These books help to accentuate the franchise instead of just cherry picking a theme and style This was a pretty impressive little four book series Especially when you consider the source material they are working with and the audience they are aiming for But I would happily read a hundred book series with this much thought and effort Collected
