Tom Fowler revealed the arc would be inspired by the first season of Rick and Morty having then not seen the second season in particular Rick Potion and that as the veteran illustrator s writing debut he would be carte blanche to do anything as long as you can come up with some kind of a scientific explanation that s both coherently and comedically relevant with one issue of Zac Gorman s run additionally providing inspiration for the three issue arc In one issue of Zac Gorman s that I read all the way through they re in this alien death maze and there s only enough charge in the portal gun to get one of them out Rick gives Morty some kind of excuse and shoves him through Then there s this beat where Rick is alone at the end of this maze It s a silent panel and you just see how sad and like existentially alone Rick is That hit me in the gut and I said Okay that s what I m going for That s the thing I want to keep Everything else can be drawn from whatever situations I or my year old can come up with In other media In September Christopher Lloyd and Jaeden Martell respectively portrayed the Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith of Dimension C in one of a series of three promotional interstitials directed by Paul B Cummings Several Mortys inspired by Dune based third chapter of Head Space and HeRicktics of Rick were later made available as playable characters in updates to the

Player Morty with Emily Gaudette of Inverse describing Big Game as a non enthused novelization of the show and David Brooke of AIPT Comics complimenting Fowler as manag ing to capture the concept of rage and fear so damn well there s no question what is a comedically traumatic moment in depicting the inner rage of Morty Smith References
