head like you re watching an episode The Super Powered Fancast similarly lauded watching Rick be a bad ass vampire slayer in this story and drawn as being completely capable in contrast to how he s normally portrayed in particular complimenting the back and forth between Rick and Jerry as being written beautifully and flow ing really well with the visuals Bleeding Cool described the storyline as a modern day vampire classic pleasingly reading like an Adult Swim episode of Rick and Morty and a plot well made for comedy which succeeds in delivering said comedy with its art look ing and mov ing like an episode of the cartoon in particular complimenting the additional stylism a dded to make the comic feel a little distinct Collected editions References
