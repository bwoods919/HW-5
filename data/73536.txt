A cliffhanger or cliffhanger ending is a plot device in fiction which features a main character in a precarious or difficult dilemma or confronted with a shocking revelation at the end of an episode or a film of serialized fiction A cliffhanger is hoped to incentivize the audience to return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma Some serials end with the caveat To Be Continued or The End In serial films and television series the following episode sometimes begins with a recap sequence Cliffhangers were used as literary devices in several works of the Middle Ages with One Thousand and One Nights ending on a cliffhanger each night Cliffhangers appeared as an element of the Victorian era serial novel that emerged in the s with many associating the form with Charles Dickens a pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction Following the enormous success of Dickens by the s cliffhanger endings had become a staple part of the sensation serials History Cliffhangers were used as literary devices in several works of the Middle Ages The Arabic literary work One Thousand and One Nights involves Scheherazade narrating a series of stories to King Shahry r for nights with each night ending on a cliffhanger in order to save herself from execution Some medieval Chinese ballads like the Liu chih yuan chu kung tiao ended each chapter on a cliffhanger to keep the audience in suspense The Scottish comic magazine The Glasgow Looking Glass founded by English artist William Heath pioneered the use of the phrase To Be Continued in its serials in Victorian serials Cliffhangers became prominent with the serial publication of narrative fiction pioneered by Charles Dickens Printed episodically in magazines Dickens s cliffhangers triggered desperation in his readers Writing in the New Yorker Emily Nussbaum captured the anticipation of those waiting for the next installment of Dickens The Old Curiosity Shop In Dickens fanboys rioted on the dock of New York Harbor as they waited for a British ship carrying the next installment screaming Is little Nell dead On Dickens instalment format and cliffhangers first seen with The Pickwick Papers in Leslie Howsam in The Cambridge Companion to the History of the Book writes It inspired a narrative that Dickens would explore and develop throughout his career The instalments would typically culminate at a point in the plot that created reader anticipation and thus reader demand generating a plot and sub plot motif that would come to typify the novel structure With each new instalment widely anticipated with its cliffhanger ending Dickens audience was enormous his instalment format was also much more affordable and accessible to the masses with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than previous The popularity of Dickens s serial publications saw the cliffhanger become a staple part of the sensation serials by the s Dickens s influence can also be seen in television soap operas and film series with The Guardian stating the DNA of Dickens s busy episodic storytelling delivered in instalments and rife with cliffhangers and diversions is traceable in everything Etymology The term cliffhanger is considered to have originated with the serialised version of Thomas Hardy s A Pair of Blue Eyes which was published in Tinsley s Magazine between September and July in which Henry Knight one of the protagonists is left hanging off a cliff According to the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang the term s first use in print was in Serial media Early film Cliffhangers were especially popular from the s through to the s serials when nickelodeons and movie theaters filled the cultural niche later primarily occupied by television During the s when Fort Lee New Jersey was a center of film production the cliffs facing New York and the Hudson River were frequently used as film locations The most notable of these films was The Perils of Pauline a serial which helped popularize the term cliffhanger In them the serial would often end suddenly leaving actress Pearl White s Pauline character literally hanging from a cliff Modern usage Cliffhangers are often used in television series especially soap operas and game shows Several Australian soap operas which went off air over summer such as Number The Restless Years and Prisoner ended each year with a major and much publicized catastrophe such as a character being shot in the final seconds of the year s closing episode Cliffhangers are commonly used in Japanese manga and anime In contrast to American superhero comics Japanese manga are much more frequently written with cliffhangers often with each volume or issue This is particularly the case with sh nen manga especially those published by Weekly Sh nen Jump such as Dragon Ball Shaman King One Piece and the origin show of the To be continued Internet meme JoJo s Bizarre Adventure During its original run Doctor Who was written in a serialised format that usually ended each episode within a serial on a cliffhanger In the first few years of the show the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial The programme s cliffhangers sometimes caused controversy most notably Part Three of The Deadly Assassin which was altered for future broadcasts following a complaint from campaigner Mary Whitehouse Whitehouse objected to the violence of the scene the Doctor s head is held underwater in an attempt to drown him She often cited it in interviews as one of the most frightening scenes in Doctor Who her reasoning being that children would not know if the Doctor survived until the following week and that they would have this strong image in their minds during all that time The producer of Doctor Who at the time Philip Hinchcliffe cited the s radio serial Journey into Space as an influence for its use of cliffhangers A later serial Dragonfire is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved the Seventh Doctor literally hanging from a cliff seemingly by choice which has been described as the most ludicrous ever presented in Doctor Who Another British science fiction series Blake s employed end of season cliffhangers for each of the four seasons the series was on air most notably for its final episode in in which the whole of the main cast are seemingly killed The final cliffhanger was never resolved From to and in broadcast syndication Same bat time same bat channel encouraged viewers to tune in the next night for episodes of Batman The next episode quickly resolved the hero s from each supervillain s trap A few triple episodes had double cliffhangers Cliffhangers were rare on American primetime television before as television networks preferred the flexibility of airing episodes in any order The sitcom Soap was the first US primetime television programme to utilise the end of season cliffhanger at the end of its first season in Cliffhangers then went on to become a staple of American primetime soap operas the phenomenal success of the Who shot J R third season ending cliffhanger of Dallas and the Who Done It fourth season episode that finally solved the mystery contributed to the cliffhanger becoming a common storytelling device on American television Another notable cliffhanger was the Moldavian Massacre on Dynasty in which fueled speculation throughout the summer months regarding who lived or died when almost all the characters attended a wedding in the country of Moldavia only to have revolutionaries topple the government and machine gun the entire wedding party Other primetime soap operas such as Falcon Crest and Knots Landing also employed dramatic end of season cliffhangers on an annual basis Sitcoms also utilised the cliffhanger device As well as the aforementioned Soap the long running sitcom Cheers would often incorporate cliffhanger season endings largely in its earlier years to increase interest in the on and off relationship between its two lead characters Sam Malone and Diane Chambers These cliffhangers did not place the characters in peril of any kind but rather left their relationship which was at the core of the show hanging in the balance Cliffhanger endings in films date back to the early th century and were prominently used in the serial films of the s such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers though these tended to be resolved with the next installment the following week A longer term cliffhanger was employed in the Star Wars film series in The Empire Strikes Back in which Darth Vader made a shock revelation to Luke Skywalker and Han Solo s life was left in jeopardy after he was frozen and taken away by a bounty hunter These plotlines were left unresolved until the next film in the series which was released three years later The first two films in the Back to the Future series end in cliffhangers with the first displaying the to be continued title card The two main ways for cliffhangers to keep readers viewers coming back is to either involve characters in a suspenseful possibly life threatening situation or to feature a sudden shocking revelation Cliffhangers are also used to leave open the possibility of a character being killed off due to the actor not continuing to play the role Cliffhangers are also sometimes deliberately inserted by writers who are uncertain whether a new series or season will be commissioned in the hope that viewers will demand to know how the situation is resolved Such was the case with the second season of Twin Peaks which ended in a cliffhanger similar to the first season with a high degree of uncertainty about the fate of the protagonist but the cliffhanger could not save the show from being canceled resulting in the unresolved ending The final episodes of soaps Dallas and Dynasty also ended in similar fashion though all three shows would return years later in some form or other to resolve these storylines The Australian soap opera Return To Eden ended in with a dramatic cliffhanger in anticipation of a second season However the network chose not to renew the show and so a hastily filmed five minute conclusion was filmed and added on to the end of existing final episode to provide closure Some shows however became known for never being resolved In addition to the aforementioned Blake s the supernatural series Angel the original series V and its remake all ended with unresolved cliffhangers On occasion TV series are given the opportunity to resolve their end of series cliffhangers at a later date examples include the series Farscape which was cancelled after a cliffhanger ending but which was able to resolve it in a later follow up miniseries Farscape The Peacekeeper Wars and the aforementioned Twin Peaks cliffhanger which was resolved years later when a sequel to the series considered a third season aired in The cliffhanger has become a genre staple especially in comics due to the multi part storylines becoming the norm instead of self contained stories to such a degree in fact that series writers no longer feel they have to be immediately resolved or even referenced when the next episode is shown variously because the writer didn t feel it was a strong enough opener or simply couldn t be bothered The heavily serialized television drama True Blood has become notorious for cliffhangers Not only do the seasons conclude with cliffhangers but almost every episode finishes at a cliffhanger directly after or during a highly dramatic moment much like the primetime soap operas of the s and s Commercial breaks can be a nuisance to script writers because some sort of incompleteness or minor cliffhanger should be provided before each to stop the viewer from changing channels during the commercial break Sometimes a series ends with an unintended cliffhanger caused by a very abrupt ending without a satisfactory d nouement but merely assuming that the viewer will assume that everything sorted itself out Sometimes a film book or season of a television show will end with the defeat of the main villain before a second evidently more powerful villain makes a brief appearance becoming the villain of the next film Occasionally an element other than a villain is also used to tease at a sequel Peter H eg s novel Smilla s Sense of Snow ends with a deliberate cliffhanger with the protagonist and main villain involved in a life and death chase on the arctic ice off Greenland and in this case the author has no intention of ever writing a sequel the ambiguous ending being part and parcel of the basic ideas permeating the book s plot Similarly Michael Flynn s science fiction novelette The Forest of Time ends with a deliberate and permanent cliffhanger readers are not to be ever told where the protagonist ended up in his wandering the forest of alternate history timelines and whether he ever got back to his home and his beloved nor whether the war which takes a large part of the plot ended in victory for the Good Guys or the Bad Guys George Cukor when adapting in Graham Greene s Travels with My Aunt deliberately introduced a cliffhanger missing from the original While Greene s book ended with the protagonists definitely choosing the adventurous and rather shady life of smugglers in Paraguay and closing off other options for their future at the conclusion of the Cukor film a character is seen tossing a coin whose fall would determine their next move and the film ends on a freeze frame shot as the characters await the fall of the coin See also Back to back
