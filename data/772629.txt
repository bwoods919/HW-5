id: 772629
In fiction a canon is material accepted as being authentically produced by an author or an ascribed author Canon is often contrasted with or used as the basis for works of fan fiction and other derivative works Canonicity When there are multiple official works or original media what material is canonical can be unclear This is resolved either by explicitly excluding certain media from the status of canon as in the case of Star Trek and Star Wars by assigning different levels of canonicity to different media as was in the case of Star Wars before its ownership by Disney by considering different but licensed media treatments official and equally canonical to the series timeline within their own continuities universe but not across them or not resolved at all There is also no consensus regarding who has the authority to decide what is or isn t canon with copyright holders usually declaring themselves the authorities when they want to erase or retcon materials that were approved by the setting s original creator with Star Wars again being an example The use of canon is of particular importance with regard to reboots or re imaginings of established franchises such as the Star Trek remake because of the ways in which it influences the viewer experience Examples The official Star Trek website describes Star Trek canon as the events that take place within the episodes and movies referring to the live action television series and films with Star Trek The Animated Series having long existed in a nebulous gray area of canonicity Events characters and storylines from tie in novels comic books and video games are explicitly excluded from the Star Trek canon but the site notes that elements from these sources have been subsequently introduced into the television series and says that canon is not something set in stone During George Lucas time with the franchise Star Wars canon was divided into discrete tiers that incorporated the Expanded Universe EU with continuity tracked by Lucasfilm creative executive Leland Chee Higher tier and newer material abrogated lower tier and older material in case of contradiction The live action theatrical films the The Clone Wars TV series and its debut film and statements by Lucas himself were at the top of this hierarchy such works invariably superseded EU material in case of contradiction The EU itself was further divided into several descending levels of continuity After Disney s acquisition of the franchise Lucasfilm designated all Expanded Universe material published prior to April other than the first six theatrical films and the The Clone Wars film and TV series as the non canonical Legends continuity Material released since this announcement is a separate canonical timeline from the original George Lucas Canon with all narrative development overseen by the Lucasfilm Story Group The makers of Doctor Who have generally avoided making pronouncements about canonicity with Russell T Davies explaining that he does not think about the concept for the Doctor Who television series or its spin offs Additional works Other writers The canon status of some works by the original writer but not the same publisher such as The Field Bazaar may be debated This is because copyright used to be exercised by the publisher of the work of literature rather than the author Campaigning by Victor Hugo led to the Berne Convention which introduced author s rights However sometimes in literature original writers have not approved works as canon but original publishers or literary estates of original writers posthumously approve subsequent works as canon such as The Royal Book of Oz by original publisher Porto Bello Gold by estate and Heidi Grows Up by estate Late th century In film and television this is common that the original writer does not decide canon In literature the estate of H G Wells authorised sequels by Stephen Baxter The Massacre of Mankind and The Time Ships Scarlett was a sequel to Gone with the Wind authorised by the estate st century In the Conan Doyle estate authorised Young Sherlock Holmes and The House of Silk Sequels to the stories by P G Wodehouse about the butler Jeeves were sanctioned by Wodehouse s estate for Jeeves and the Wedding Bells by Sebastian Faulks and Jeeves and the King of Clubs by Ben Schott The Monogram Murders by Sophie Hannah is a sequel to Hercule Poirot novels authorised by the Agatha Christie estate Fanon Fan fiction is almost never regarded as canonical However certain ideas may become influential or widely accepted within fan communities who refer to such ideas as fanon a blend of fan and canon Similarly the term headcanon is used to describe a fan s personal interpretation of a fictional universe See also
