David Paul Cronenberg born March is a Canadian film director screenwriter and actor He is a principal originator of the genre commonly known as body horror with his films exploring visceral bodily transformation infectious diseases and the intertwining of the psychological the physical and the technological Cronenberg is best known for exploring these themes through sci fi horror films such as Shivers Scanners Videodrome and The Fly though he has also directed dramas psychological thrillers and gangster films Cronenberg s films have polarized critics and audiences alike he has earned critical acclaim and has sparked controversy for his depictions of gore and violence The Village Voice called him the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English speaking world His films have won numerous awards including the Special Jury Prize for Crash at the Cannes Film Festival a unique award that is distinct from the Jury Prize as it is not given annually but only at the request of the official jury who in this case gave the award for originality for daring and for audacity From the s to the s Cronenberg collaborated on several films with Viggo Mortensen including A History of Violence Eastern Promises A Dangerous Method and Crimes of the Future Six of his films were selected to compete for the Palme d Or the most recent being Crimes of the Future which was screened at the Cannes Film Festival Early life David Cronenberg was born in Toronto Ontario on March Cronenberg is the son of Esther n e Sumberg a musician and Milton Cronenberg a writer and editor He was raised in a middle class progressive Jewish family His father was born in Baltimore Maryland and his mother was born in Toronto all of his grandparents were Jews from Lithuania Milton wrote some short stories for True Detective and had a column in the Toronto Telegram for around thirty years The Cronenberg household was full of a wide variety of books and Cronenberg s father tried to introduce his son to art films such as The Seventh Seal although at the time Cronenberg was more interested in western and pirate films showing a particular affinity for those featuring Burt Lancaster A voracious reader from an early age Cronenberg started off enjoying science fiction magazines like The Magazine of Fantasy Science Fiction Galaxy and Astounding where he first encountered authors who would prove influential on his own work including Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov although he wouldn t encounter his primary influence Philip K Dick until much later Cronenberg also read comic books noting his favorites were Tarzan Little Lulu Uncle Scrooge Blackhawk Plastic Man Superman and the original Fawcett Comics version of Captain Marvel later known as Shazam Although as an adult Cronenberg feels superhero films are artistically limited he maintains a fondness for Captain Marvel Shazam criticizing how he feels the character had been neglected Cronenberg also read horror comics published by EC which in contrast to the others he described as scary and bizarre and violent and nasty the ones your mother didn t want you to have Early films that later proved influential on Cronenberg s career include avant garde horror science fiction and thriller films such as Un Chien Andalou Vampyr War of the Worlds Freaks Creature from the Black Lagoon Alphaville Performance and Duel However Cronenberg has also cited less obvious films as influences including comedies like The Bed Sitting Room as well as Disney cartoons such as Bambi and Dumbo Cronenberg said he found these two Disney animated films as well as Universal s live action Blue Lagoon terrifying which influenced his approach to horror Cronenberg went on to say that Bambi was the first important film he ever saw citing the moment when Bambi s mother died as particularly powerful Cronenberg even wished to screen Bambi as part of a museum exhibition of his influences but Disney refused him permission In terms of conventional horror films that frightened him Cronenberg cited Don t Look Now Cronenberg attended Dewson Street Public School Kent Senior School Harbord Collegiate Institute and North Toronto Collegiate Institute He enrolled at the University of Toronto for Honours Science in but changed to Honours English Language and Literature the next year He graduated from university in at the top of his class with a general bachelor of arts Cronenberg decided to not study for a master of arts after making Stereo Cronenberg s fascination with the film Winter Kept Us Warm by classmate David Secter sparked his interest in film He began frequenting film camera rental houses and learned the art of filmmaking Cronenberg made two short films Transfer and From the Drain with a few hundred dollars Cronenberg Ivan Reitman Bob Fothergill and Iain Ewing were inspired by Jonas Mekas and formed the Toronto Film Co op Career After two short sketch films and two short art house features the black and white Stereo and the colour Crimes of the Future Cronenberg went into partnership with Ivan Reitman The Canadian government provided financing for his films throughout the s During this period he focused on his signature body horror films such as Shivers and Rabid the latter of which provided pornographic actress Marilyn Chambers with work in a different genre although Cronenberg s first choice for the role had been a then little known Sissy Spacek Rabid was a breakthrough with international distributors and his next two horror features The Brood and Scanners gained stronger support Even at this stage however Cronenberg showed variety by making Fast Company between The Brood and Rabid a project reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs Cronenberg has cited William S Burroughs and Vladimir Nabokov as influences Perhaps the best example of a film that straddles the line between his works of personal chaos and psychological confusion is Cronenberg s adaptation of Naked Lunch his literary hero William S Burroughs most controversial book The novel was considered unfilmable and Cronenberg acknowledged that a straight translation into film would cost million dollars and be banned in every country in the world Instead much like in his earlier film Videodrome he consistently blurred the lines between what appeared to be reality and what appeared to be hallucinations brought on by the main character s drug addiction Some of the book s moments as well as incidents loosely based upon Burroughs life are presented in this manner within the film Cronenberg stated that while writing the screenplay for Naked Lunch he felt a moment of synergy with Burroughs writing style He felt the connection between his screenwriting style and Burroughs prose style was so strong that he jokingly remarked that should Burroughs pass on I ll just write his next book Cronenberg has said that his films should be seen from the point of view of the disease and that in Shivers for example he identifies with the characters after they become infected with the anarchic parasites Disease and disaster in Cronenberg s work are less problems to be overcome than agents of personal transformation Of his characters transformations Cronenberg said But because of our necessity to impose our own structure of perception on things we look on ourselves as being relatively stable But in fact when I look at a person I see this maelstrom of organic chemical and electron chaos volatility and instability shimmering and the ability to change and transform and transmute Similarly in Crash people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as a fertilizing rather than a destructive event In Cronenberg publicly disagreed with Paul Haggis choice of the same name for the latter s Oscar winning film Crash arguing that it was very disrespectful to the important and seminal J G Ballard novel on which Cronenberg s film was based Aside from The Dead Zone and The Fly Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big budget mainstream Hollywood filmmaking although he has had occasional near misses At one stage he was considered by George Lucas as a possible director for Return of the Jedi but was passed over Cronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of Total Recall but experienced creative differences with producers Dino De Laurentiis and Ronald Shusett a different version of the film was eventually made by Paul Verhoeven A fan of Philip K Dick s author of We Can Remember it For You Wholesale the short story upon which the film was based Cronenberg related in the biography overview of his work Cronenberg on Cronenberg that his dissatisfaction with what he envisioned the film to be and what it ended up being pained him so greatly that for a time he suffered a migraine just thinking about it akin to a needle piercing his eye In the late s Cronenberg was announced as director of a sequel to another Verhoeven film Basic Instinct but this also fell through His thriller A History of Violence is one of his highest budgeted and most accessible to date He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low budgeted Spider but it was one of his most critically acclaimed films to date along with Eastern Promises a film about the struggle of one man to gain power in the Russian Mafia Cronenberg has collaborated with composer Howard Shore on all of his films since The Brood see List of film director and composer collaborations with the exception of The Dead Zone which was scored by Michael Kamen Other regular collaborators include actor Robert Silverman art director Carol Spier also his sister sound editor Bryan Day film editor Ronald Sanders his sister costume designer Denise Cronenberg and from until cinematographer Mark Irwin In Cronenberg directed Howard Shore s first opera The Fly Since Dead Ringers Cronenberg has worked with cinematographer Peter Suschitzky on each of his films see List of film director and cinematographer collaborations Suschitzky was the director of photography for The Empire Strikes Back and Cronenberg remarked that Suschitzky s work in that film was the only one of those movies that actually looked good which was a motivating factor to work with him on Dead Ringers Although Cronenberg has worked with a number of Hollywood stars he remains a staunchly Canadian filmmaker with nearly all of his films including major studio vehicles The Dead Zone and The Fly having been filmed in his home province Ontario Notable exceptions include M Butterfly most of which was shot in China Spider and Eastern Promises which were both filmed primarily in England and A Dangerous Method which was filmed in Germany and Austria Rabid and Shivers were shot in and around Montreal Most of his films have been at least partially financed by Telefilm Canada and Cronenberg a vocal supporter of government backed film projects has said Every country needs a system of government grants to have a national cinema in the face of Hollywood In Cronenberg realized two extra cinematographic projects the exhibition Chromosomes at the Rome Film Fest and the opera The Fly at the LaOpera in Los Angeles and Theatre Ch telet in Paris In July Cronenberg completed production on A Dangerous Method an adaptation of Christopher Hampton s play The Talking Cure starring Keira Knightley Michael Fassbender Vincent Cassel and frequent collaborator Viggo Mortensen The film was produced

a companion piece to his remake of The Fly which he would like to direct if given the chance He has stated that it is not a traditional sequel but rather a parallel story For a time it appeared that as Eastern Promises producer Paul Webster told Screen International a sequel is in the works that would reunite the key team of Cronenberg Steven Knight and Viggo Mortensen The film was to be made by Webster s new production company Shoebox Films in collaboration with Focus Features and shot in early However in Cronenberg commented that the Eastern Promises sequel had fallen through due to budget disagreement with Focus Features Filming for Cronenberg s next film a satire drama entitled Maps to the Stars with Julianne Moore Mia Wasikowska John Cusack and Robert Pattinson began on July in

differences They had one daughter Cassandra Cronenberg His second wife was film editor Carolyn Zeifman to whom he was married until her death in The couple met on the set of Rabid while she was working as a production assistant They have two children Caitlin and Brandon In the book Cronenberg on Cronenberg he revealed that The Brood was inspired by events that occurred during the unraveling of his first marriage which caused both Cronenberg and his daughter Cassandra a great deal of turmoil The character Nola Carveth mother of the brood is based on Cassandra s mother Cronenberg said that he found the shooting of the climactic scene in which Nola was strangled by her husband to be very satisfying In a September interview Cronenberg revealed that film director Martin Scorsese admitted to him that he was intrigued by Cronenberg s early work but was subsequently terrified to meet him in person Cronenberg responded to Scorsese You re the guy who made Taxi Driver and you re afraid to meet me In the same interview Cronenberg identified as an atheist Anytime I ve tried to imagine squeezing myself into the box of any particular religion I find it claustrophobic and oppressive Cronenberg elaborated I think atheism is an acceptance of what is real In the same interview Cronenberg revealed that it depends on the time of day as to whether or not he is afraid of death He further stated that he is not concerned about posthumous representations of his film work It wouldn t disturb me to think that my work would just sink beneath the waves without trace and that would be it So what It doesn t bother me In Cronenberg on Cronenberg the director further elaborated that he was raised in a secular Jewish home and while he and his family had no disdain towards any religion such matters were not discussed In the same book Cronenberg said that in his teens he went through a phase where he wondered about the existence of God but ultimately came to the conclusion that the God concept was developed to cope with the fear of death In a interview Cronenberg explained the role atheism plays in his work He stated I m interested in saying Let us discuss the existential question We are all going to die that is the end of all consciousness There is no afterlife There is no God Now what do we do That s the point where it starts getting interesting to me In Cronenberg s later films e g A History of Violence Eastern Promises and A Dangerous Method openly religious characters become more common During an interview for A History of Violence Cronenberg even chose to identify as a materialist rather than an atheist stating I m not an atheist but for me to turn away from any aspect of the human body to me is a philosophical betrayal And there s a lot of art and religion whose whole purpose is to turn away from the human body I feel in my art that my mandate is to not do that In a separate interview Cronenberg discussed the role religion plays in his films using Eastern Promises as the main example I m an atheist but not all my characters are atheists So it s true that I don t think about God ever as part of my life or anything But if you re a dramatist and you are working with characters who come from a particular culture you have to accept their understanding of life and with passion So the Nikolai character I m pretty sure he believes in God and most of the other characters in the movie do too Some of them are Muslim some of them are Eastern Orthodox and that s a part of their life a part of their understanding of suffering Because everybody in life suffers but not everybody thinks of that in religious terms These people do And they think of suffering as a way to salvation also in religious terms I am their God really as I am creating them that s religious in itself I am a very hardcore atheist believe me but you become like an actor really as a director or a writer You must take on the character as that character is and believe in it as you re playing it To allow that character to exist as he would exist That s really what it s all about so I have no problem with characters who are religious and believe in God I would have a problem if that was the point of the whole story because that bores me and I just don t have any emotional or intellectual respect for it frankly Filmography Films Acting roles Short films Television
