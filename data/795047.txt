id: 795047
In politics a front runner also spelled frontrunner or front runner is a leader in an electoral race While the front runner in athletic events the namesake of the political concept is generally clear a political front runner particularly in the presidential primary process is less so as a potential nominee may lead in the polls have the most name recognition the most funds raised or a combination of these The front runner is most often declared by the media who are following the race and is written about in a different style than his or her challengers Etymology The word front runner originated in the United States The term emerged from foot racing It was used by According to Merriam Webster the term meant a contestant who runs best when in the lead by that time However the Dictionary of American Slang says it meant the leader in a contest election etc by that year The adjective front running was used by It also originated from racing The meaning of the word was analogous to its nounal counterpart at that time The term was used as a noun by in the United States to mean support given to a person or team only when they are doing well By the s a new definition for front running emerged from the commodities market in which the word was also used as a noun The definition was used to describe a type of fraud in which a trader withholds a large customer order so that he can personally profit from its effect on the market The intransitive verb front run emerged by It originated from a back formation of front runner By that year it had a meaning that was analogous to its nounal counterpart The related word frontrunneritis was used by It is a combination of frontrunner and itis a suffix frequently used informally to describe a tendency or mood that is comparable to a disease The term was used by that time to describe the condition of being a leading candidate In particular it was used to characterize a tendency to coast or to be under increased scrutiny by the press Performance American author columnist journalist and presidential speechwriter William Safire describes the front runner as being able to leave the starting gate well and set the pace for the other contestants He uses the racing term shows early foot to characterize this tendency Safire says occasionally the front runner s lead becomes insurmountable He cites Barry Goldwater s successful Republican presidential nomination and Jimmy Carter s success in several convention states and early primaries in his presidential campaign as examples However Safire says the modern usage of the word front runner has ominous overtones of being likely to eventually lose As an example he references Franklin D Roosevelt s receiving a letter from Robert W Woolley about Roosevelt s front runner status early in his presidential campaign Herein lies the danger automatically you become the target of the other candidates real and potential There isn t a single favorite son whose delegation won t be held out of the Roosevelt column so long as there is a reasonable chance of getting something for that favorite son even at your expense Safire gives another example when he quotes Ted Sorensen s thoughts about John F Kennedy s front runner status during his presidential campaign There were disadvantages in being the front runner The Senator s critics became more open and vocal and his every word was politically interpreted The outcome of the second round of primaries is critical to a front runner s success Safire argues that the front runner must come thundering into the convention increasing his speed and with enough kick left for a final spurt to be successful He quotes Thomas E Dewey writing about his losing the Republican presidential nomination as an example When the balloting starts every candidate wants to show enough strength to be one of the leaders on the first ballot He also wants to have enough strength in reserve so he can gain on the psychologically important second ballot For example in I led on the first three ballots out of six the wrong three I lost ground on the second ballot That was the beginning of the end and everybody knew it Safire states that front runners often take advantage of the bandwagon effect by emphasizing their inevitability factor He says this is done by suggesting the futility of the front runner s opponents However Safire notes that a front runner s inevitability can be vulnerable to their opponents Safire cites the example of George W Bush s front runner status in the Republican primary being threatened by John McCain s victory in the New Hampshire primary Another example he notes is Gary Hart s upset win in the New Hampshire primary which challenged Walter Mondale s front runner status in the Democratic primary Safire quotes Peter Hart a pollster who advised Walter Mondale commenting on the race in Inevitability is not a message there needs to be something to grab on to Inevitability is not a tune that people can march to Safire also cites journalist Adam Gourney s thoughts N othing invites a teardown more than being perceived as the front runner Being on top makes you a big target for your opponents and the news media and sets you up for buyer s remorse a common phenomenon in the nomination process even before the sale is done Safire says that despite the risks in being the front runner candidates prefer it over being a dark horse or a long shot because that position has a higher chance of winning Front runners often have a financial advantage over dark horses Early front runners David Greenberg associate professor of History and of Journalism and Media Studies at Rutgers University states that front runners decided by early polls often do not win the nomination Greenberg notes that early polls decided Birch Bayh in the Democratic primary Ted Kennedy in the Democratic primary Jesse Jackson in the Democratic primary Jerry Brown in the Democratic primary Howard Dean in the Democratic primary and Herman Cain in the Republican primary as front runners all of whom lost the nomination Greenberg suggests that the futility of most early front runners reflects early polls unreliability and in particular their respondents indifference to the candidates He notes that indifference is especially justified for electorates whose state primary runs during the later stages of the race He cites David Karol a political scientist who says that t he media don t always report the numbers that say not sure or don t know enough Greenberg states that the rise of early front runners is partly due to name recognition He cites the early lead of Donald Trump in the Republican primary Joe Lieberman in the Democratic primary and George W Bush in the Republican primary as examples of this He further states that early front runners are established in part due to recent media attention and notes that Jonathan Bernstein a political scientist and columnist shares this view Greenberg cites the early front runners Donald Trump in the Republican primary Gary Hart in the Democratic primary and Howard Dean in the Democratic primary as examples of this Greenberg acknowledges that some front runners decided by early polls win the nomination He states that this often occurs in races with few competitors He notes Al Gore s early lead in before winning the Democratic presidential nomination as an example Greenberg states that early front runners can also win if they are an overwhelming favorite in the race He gives Ronald Reagan s early front runner status in before winning the Republican presidential nomination as an example Greenberg notes that William Mayer a political scientist at Northeastern University discovered that in contested primary races since of the eight front runners who polled at percent or higher in the September before the election six won the nomination and none of the five front runners who polled below that percentage won Debates Primary debate participation may hinder a front runner s chance to be nominated Debate analysts and scholars recognize that the front runner is often attacked more frequently by the other candidates It is a common strategy of the front runner s opponents especially for long shot candidates During the December Republican primary debate almost all attacks were directed against the front runner George W Bush Long shot candidates Gary Bauer Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyes significantly contributed to the mass attack In a debate featuring the Democratic primary candidates long shot candidates gang ed up on the front runner Analysis on a primary debate showed that the front runner received the most attacks However excessively attacking the front runner can hurt one s image and support from viewers In the December Republican primary debate all of Steve Forbes attacks were made against George W Bush contributing to over half of the total attacks that targeted Bush Steve Forbes experienced a negative effect on his image and lost all support he had from a sample of viewers before the debate Although reasons other than excessive attacking may have contributed to Forbes decline viewers had a clear negative reaction to his constant attack of Bush John McCain who made no attacks had his image improved and his support from the viewers increased This suggests that a front runner s opponent may be more successful if they attack in moderation It may also suggest that if the opponent is recognized by viewers as a legitimate contender they can benefit from refraining from attacks and permitting the larger field of long shot candidates to do the dirty work of attacking a front runner This would allow the opponent to project a more positive message about their ideas See also
