title: Extraterrestrial life
id: 9588
Extraterrestrial life or alien life is life which may occur outside of Earth and which did not originate on Earth No extraterrestrial life has yet been conclusively detected although efforts are underway Such life might range from simple forms such as prokaryotes to intelligent beings possibly bringing forth civilisations that might be far more advanced than humanity The Drake equation speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe The science of extraterrestrial life is known as astrobiology Speculation about the possibility of inhabited worlds outside the planet Earth dates back to antiquity Multiple early Christian writers discussed the idea of a plurality of worlds as proposed by earlier thinkers such as Democritus Augustine references Epicurus s idea of innumerable worlds throughout the boundless immensity of space originally expressed in his Letter to Herodotus in The City of God In his first century poem De rerum natura Book the Epicurean philosopher Lucretius predicted that humanity would find innumerable exoplanets with life forms similar to and different from the ones on Earth and even other races of man Pre modern writers typically assumed extraterrestrial worlds are inhabited by living beings William Vorilong in the th century acknowledged the possibility that Jesus could have visited extraterrestrial worlds to redeem their inhabitants Nicholas of Cusa wrote in that Earth is a brilliant star like other celestial objects visible in space which would appear similar to the Sun from an exterior perspective due to a layer of fiery brightness in the outer layer of the atmosphere He theorised all extraterrestrial bodies could be inhabited by men plants and animals including the Sun Descartes wrote that there was no means to prove that the stars were not inhabited by intelligent creatures but their existence was a matter of speculation The writings of these individuals demonstrate interest in extraterrestrial life has existed throughout history although only recently have humans have had any means of investigating it Since the mid th century active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life Depending on the category of search methods range from the analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and transmit communications The concept of extraterrestrial life and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence has had a major cultural impact especially extraterrestrials in fiction Science fiction has communicated scientific ideas imagined a wide range of possibilities and influenced public interest in and perspectives on extraterrestrial life One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence Some encourage aggressive methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial life Others citing the tendency of technologically advanced human societies to enslave or destroy less advanced societies argue it may be dangerous to actively draw attention to Earth Context Extraterrestrial life may exist on planets other than Earth Such lifeforms would range from simple microorganisms and multicellular organisms similar to animals or plants to complex alien intelligences akin to humans When scientists talk about extraterrestrial life they consider all those types Although it is possible that extraterrestrial life may have other configurations scientists use the hierarchy of lifeforms from Earth for simplicity as it is the only one known to exist According to Big Bang interpretations the universe as a whole was initially too hot to allow life million years later it cooled to temperate levels but the elements that make up living things did not exist yet The only freely available elements at that point were hydrogen and helium Carbon and oxygen and later water would not appear until million years later created through stellar fusion At that point the difficulty for life to appear was not the temperature but the scarcity of free heavy elements Planetary systems emerged and the first organic compounds may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains that would eventually create rocky planets like Earth Although Earth was in a molten state after its birth and may have burned any organics that fell in it it would have been more receptive once it cooled down Once the right conditions on Earth were met life started by a chemical process known as abiogenesis Alternatively life may have formed less frequently then spread by meteoroids for example between habitable planets in a process called panspermia There is an area around a star the circumstellar habitable zone or Goldilocks zone where water may be at the right temperature to exist in liquid form at a planetary surface This area is neither too close to the star where water would become steam nor too far away where water would be frozen as a rock However although useful as an approximation planetary habitability is complex and defined by several factors Being in the habitable zone is not enough for a planet to be habitable not even to actually have such liquid water Venus is located in the habitable zone of the Solar System but does not have liquid water because of the conditions of its atmosphere Jovian planets or Gas Giants are not considered habitable even if they orbit close enough to their stars as hot Jupiters The actual distances for the habitable zones vary according to the type of star and even the solar activity of each specific star influences the local habitability The type of star also defines the time the habitable zone will exist as its presence and limits will change along with the star s stellar evolution Life on Earth is quite ubiquitous across the planet and has adapted over time to almost all the available environments in it even the most hostile ones As a result it is inferred that life in other celestial bodies may be equally adaptative However the origin of life is unrelated to its ease of adaptation and may have stricter requirements A planet or moon may not have any life on it even if it was habitable Likelihood of existence It is unclear if life and intelligent life are ubiquitous in the cosmos or rare The hypothesis of ubiquitous extraterrestrial life relies on the vast size and consistent physical laws of the observable universe According to this argument made by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking it would be improbable for life not to exist somewhere else other than Earth This argument is embodied in the Copernican principle which states that Earth does not occupy a unique position in the Universe and the mediocrity principle which states that there is nothing special about life on Earth Other authors consider instead that life in the cosmos or at least multicellular life may be actually rare The Rare Earth hypothesis maintains that life on Earth is possible because of a series of factors that range from the location in the galaxy and the configuration of the Solar System to local characteristics of the planet and that it is unlikely that all such requirements are simultaneously met by another planet The proponents of this hypothesis consider that very little evidence suggests the existence of extraterrestrial life and that at this point it is just a desired result and not a reasonable scientific explanation for any gathered data In astronomer and astrophysicist Frank Drake devised the Drake equation as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence SETI The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active communicative extraterrestrial civilisations in the Milky Way galaxy The Drake equation is N R f p n e f f i f c L displaystyle N R ast cdot f p cdot n e cdot f ell cdot f i cdot f c cdot L where N the number of Milky Way galaxy civilisations already capable of communicating across interplanetary spaceand R the average rate of star formation in our galaxy fp the fraction of those stars that have planets ne the average number of planets that can potentially support life fl the fraction of planets that actually support life fi the fraction of planets with life that evolves to become intelligent life civilisations fc the fraction of civilisations that develop a technology to broadcast detectable signs of their existence into space L the length of time over which such civilisations broadcast detectable signals into spaceDrake s proposed estimates are as follows but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution displaystyle cdot cdot cdot cdot cdot cdot The Drake equation has proved controversial since although it is written as a math equation none of its values were known at the time Although some values may eventually be measured others are based on social sciences and are not knowable by their very nature This does not allow to make noteworthy conclusions Based on observations from the Hubble Space Telescope there are nearly trillion galaxies in the observable universe It is estimated that at least ten percent of all Sun like stars have a system of planets i e there are stars with planets orbiting them in the observable universe Even if it is assumed that only one out of a billion of these stars has planets supporting life there would be some billion life supporting planetary systems in the observable universe A study based on results from the Kepler spacecraft estimated that the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars resulting in billion exoplanets The apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilisations and the lack of evidence for such civilisations is known as the Fermi paradox Biochemical basis The first basic requirement for life is an environment with non equilibrium thermodynamics which means that the thermodynamic equilibrium must be broken by a source of energy The traditional sources of energy in the cosmos are the stars such as for life on Earth which depends on the energy of the sun However there are other alternative energy sources such as volcanos plate tectonics and hydrothermal vents There are ecosystems on Earth in deep areas of the ocean that do not receive sunlight and take energy from black smokers instead Magnetic fields and radioactivity have also been proposed as sources of energy although they would be less efficient ones Life on Earth requires water in a liquid state as a solvent in which biochemical reactions take place It is highly unlikely that an abiogenesis process can start within a gaseous or solid medium the atom speeds either too fast or too slow make it difficult for specific ones to meet and start chemical reactions A liquid medium also allows the transport of nutrients and substances required for metabolism Sufficient quantities of carbon and other elements along with water might enable the formation of living organisms on terrestrial planets with a chemical make up and temperature range similar to that of Earth Life based on ammonia rather than water has been suggested as an alternative though this solvent appears less suitable than water It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid hydrocarbon such as methane ethane or propane Another unknown aspect of potential extraterrestrial life would be the chemical elements that would compose it Life on Earth is largely composed of carbon but there could be other hypothetical types of biochemistry A potential replacement for carbon should be able to create complex molecules store information required for evolution and be freely available in the medium To create DNA RNA or a close analog such an element should be able to bind its atoms with many others creating complex and stable molecules It should be able to create at least three covalent bonds two for making long strings and at least a third to add new links and allow for diverse information Only nine elements meet this requirement boron nitrogen phosphorus arsenic antimony three bonds carbon silicon germanium and tin four bonds As for abundance carbon nitrogen and silicon are the most abundant ones in the universe far more than the others On Earth s crust the most abundant of those elements is silicon in the Hydrosphere it is carbon and in the atmosphere it is carbon and nitrogen Silicon however has disadvantages over carbon The molecules formed with silicon atoms are less stable and more vulnerable to acids oxygen and light An ecosystem of silicon based lifeforms would require very low temperatures high atmospheric pressure an atmosphere devoid of oxygen and a solvent other than water The low temperatures required would add an extra problem the difficulty to kickstart a process of abiogenesis to create life in the first place Even if extraterrestrial life is based on carbon and uses water as a solvent like Earth life it may still have a radically different biochemistry Life on Earth started with a RNA world and later evolved to its current form where some of the RNA tasks were transferred to the DNA and proteins Extraterrestrial life may still be stuck on the RNA world or evolve into other configurations It is unclear if our biochemistry is the most efficient one that could be generated or which elements would follow a similar pattern However it is likely that even if cells had a different composition to those from Earth they would still have a cell membrane Life on Earth jumped from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and from unicellular organisms to multicellular organisms through evolution So far no alternative process to achieve such a result has been conceived even if hypothetical Evolution requires life to be divided into individual organisms and no alternative organisation has been satisfactorily proposed either At the basic level membranes define the limit of a cell between it and its environment while remaining partially open to exchange energy and resources with it The evolution from simple cells to eukaryotes and from them to multicellular lifeforms is not guaranteed The Cambrian explosion took place thousands of millions of years after the origin of life and its causes are not fully known yet On the other hand the jump to multicellularity took place several times which suggests that it could be a case of convergent evolution and so likely to take place on other planets as well Palaeontologist Simon Conway Morris considers that convergent evolution would lead to kingdoms similar to our plants and animals and that many features are likely to develop in alien animals as well such as bilateral symmetry limbs digestive systems and heads with sensory organs Scientists from the University of Oxford analysed it from the perspective of evolutionary theory and wrote in a study in the International Journal of Astrobiology that aliens may be similar to humans The planetary context would also have an influence a planet with higher gravity would have smaller animals and other types of stars can lead to non green photosynthesisers The amount of energy available would also affect biodiversity as an ecosystem sustained by black smokers or hydrothermal vents would have less energy available than those sustained by a star s light and heat and so its lifeforms would not grow beyond a certain complexity There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential niches a planet contains and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments which in turn can be computed from its niches Planetary habitability in the Solar System The Solar System has a wide variety of planets dwarf planets and moons and each one is studied for its potential to host life Each one has its own specific conditions that may benefit or harm life So far the only lifeforms found are those from Earth No extraterrestrial intelligence other than humans exists or has ever existed within the Solar System Astrobiologist Mary Voytek points out that it would be unlikely to find large ecosystems as they would have already been detected by now The inner Solar System is likely devoid of life However Venus is still of interest to astrobiologists as it is a terrestrial planet that was likely similar to Earth in its early stages and developed in a different way There is a greenhouse effect the surface is the hottest in the Solar System sulfuric acid clouds all surface liquid water is lost and it has a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with huge pressure Comparing both helps to understand the precise differences that lead to beneficial or harmful conditions for life And despite the conditions against life on Venus there are suspicions that microbial lifeforms may still survive in high altitude clouds Mars is a cold and almost airless desert inhospitable to life However recent studies revealed that water on Mars used to be quite abundant forming rivers lakes and perhaps even oceans Mars may have been habitable back then and life on Mars may have been possible But when the planetary core ceased to generate a magnetic field solar winds removed the atmosphere and the planet became vulnerable to solar radiation Ancient lifeforms may still have left fossilised remains and microbes may still survive deep underground The gas giants have crushing atmospheric pressures and are not likely places either The most distant bodies are in permanent cold and locked in deep freeze but can not be ruled out completely Although the ice giants themselves are not likely to have life there is much hope to find it in some of the many moons of those planets Europa from the Jovian system has a subsurface ocean below a thick layer of ice Ganymede and Callisto also have subsurface oceans but life is less likely in them because water is sandwiched between layers of solid ice Europa would have contact between the ocean and the rocky surface which helps the chemical reactions It may be difficult to dig so deep in order to study those oceans though Enceladus a tiny moon of Saturn with another subsurface ocean may not need to be dug as it releases water to space in eruption columns The space probe Cassini flew inside one of those but could not make a full study because NASA did not expect this phenomenon and did not equip the probe to study ocean water Still it could detect complex organic molecules salts evidence of hydrothermal activity hydrogen and methane Titan is the only celestial body in the Solar System besides Earth that has liquid bodies on the surface It has rivers lakes and rain of hydrocarbons methane and ethane and even a cycle similar to Earth s water cycle This special context encourages speculations about lifeforms with different biochemistry but the cold temperatures would make such chemistry take place at a very slow pace Water is rock solid on the surface but Titan has a subsurface ocean like other moons However it is too deep and it would be very difficult to access it for study Scientific search The science that searches and studies life in the universe both on Earth and elsewhere is called astrobiology With the study of Earth s life the only known form of life astrobiology seeks to study how life starts and evolves and the requirements for its continuous existence This helps to determine what to look for when searching for life in other celestial bodies This is a complex area of study and uses the combined perspectives of several scientific disciplines such as astronomy biology chemistry geology oceanography and atmospheric sciences The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly As of September exoplanets in systems have been identified and other planets and moons in the Solar System hold the potential for hosting primitive life such as microorganisms As of February an updated status of studies considering the possible detection of lifeforms on Venus via phosphine and Mars via methane was reported Search for basic life Scientists search for biosignatures within the Solar System by studying planetary surfaces and examining meteorites Some claim to have identified evidence that microbial life has existed on Mars In a controversial report stated that structures resembling nanobacteria were discovered in a meteorite ALH formed of rock ejected from Mars Although all the unusual properties of the meteorite were eventually explained as the result of inorganic processes the controversy over its discovery laid the groundwork for the development of astrobiology An experiment on the two Viking Mars landers reported gas emissions from heated Martian soil samples that some scientists argue are consistent with the presence of living microorganisms Lack of corroborating evidence from other experiments on the same samples suggests that a non biological reaction is a more likely hypothesis In February NASA scientists reported they may have found some evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars The two scientists Carol Stoker and Larry Lemke of NASA s Ames Research Center based their claim on methane signatures found in Mars s atmosphere resembling the methane production of some forms of primitive life on Earth as well as on their own study of primitive life near the Rio Tinto river in Spain NASA officials soon distanced NASA from the scientists claims and Stoker herself backed off from her initial assertions In November NASA launched the Mars Science Laboratory that landed the Curiosity rover on Mars It is designed to assess the past and present habitability on Mars using a variety of scientific instruments The rover landed on Mars at Gale Crater in August A group of scientists at Cornell University started a catalog of microorganisms with the way each one reacts to sunlight The goal is to help with the search for similar organisms in exoplanets as the starlight reflected by planets rich in such organisms would have a specific spectrum unlike that of starlight reflected from lifeless planets If Earth was studied from afar with this system it would reveal a shade of green as a result of the abundance of plants with photosynthesis In August NASA studied meteorites found on Antarctica finding adenine guanine hypoxanthine and xanthine Adenine and guanine are components of DNA and the others are used in other biological processes The studies ruled out pollution of the meteorites on Earth as those components would not be freely available the way they were found in the samples This discovery suggests that several organic molecules that serve as building blocks of life may be generated within asteroids and comets In October scientists reported that cosmic dust contains complex organic matter amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic aliphatic structure that could be created naturally and rapidly by stars One of the scientists suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth and said that If this is the case life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life In August and in a world first astronomers at Copenhagen University reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule glycolaldehyde in a distant star system The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS which is located light years from Earth Glycolaldehyde is needed to form ribonucleic acid or RNA which is similar in function to DNA This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation Search for extraterrestrial intelligences Projects such as SETI are monitoring the galaxy for electromagnetic interstellar communications from civilizations on other worlds If there is an advanced extraterrestrial civilization there is no guarantee that it is transmitting radio communications in the direction of Earth or that this information could be interpreted as such by humans The length of time required for a signal to travel across the vastness of space means that any signal detected would come from the distant past The presence of heavy elements in a star s light spectrum is another potential biosignature such elements would in theory be found if the star were being used as an incinerator repository for nuclear waste products Extrasolar planets Some astronomers search for extrasolar planets that may be conducive to life narrowing the search to terrestrial planets within the habitable zones of their stars Since over four thousand exoplanets have been discovered planets in planetary systems including multiple planetary systems as of July The extrasolar planets so far discovered range in size from that of terrestrial planets similar to Earth s size to that of gas giants larger than Jupiter The number of observed exoplanets is expected to increase greatly in the coming years The Kepler space telescope has also detected a few thousand candidate planets of which about may be false positives There is at least one planet on average per star About in Sun like stars have an Earth sized planet in the habitable zone with the nearest expected to be within light years distance from Earth Assuming billion stars in the Milky Way that would be billion potentially habitable Earth sized planets in the Milky Way rising to billion if red dwarfs are included The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the trillions The nearest known exoplanet is Proxima Centauri b located light years pc from Earth in the southern constellation of Centaurus As of March the least massive exoplanet known is PSR B A which is about twice the mass of the Moon The most massive planet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive is DENIS P J b about times the mass of Jupiter although according to most definitions of a planet it is too massive to be a planet and may be a brown dwarf instead Almost all of the planets detected so far are within the Milky Way but there have also been a few possible detections of extragalactic planets The study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life One sign that a planet probably already contains life is the presence of an atmosphere with significant amounts of oxygen since that gas is highly reactive and generally would not last long without constant replenishment This replenishment occurs on Earth through photosynthetic organisms One way to analyse the atmosphere of an exoplanet is through spectrography when it transits its star though this might only be feasible with dim stars like white dwarfs History and cultural impact Cosmic pluralism Cosmic pluralism the plurality of worlds or simply pluralism describes the philosophical belief in numerous worlds in addition to Earth which might harbor extraterrestrial life Before the development of the heliocentric theory and a recognition that the Sun is just one of many stars the notion of pluralism was largely mythological and philosophical The earliest recorded assertion of extraterrestrial human life is found in ancient scriptures of Jainism There are multiple worlds mentioned in Jain scriptures that support human life These include Bharat Kshetra Mahavideh Kshetra Airavat Kshetra Hari kshetra etc Medieval Muslim writers like Fakhr al Din al Razi and Muhammad al Baqir supported cosmic pluralism on the basis of the Qur an Chaucer s poem House of Fame engaged in medieval thought experiments that postulated the plurality of worlds The first known mention of the term panspermia was in the writings of the th century BC Greek philosopher Anaxagoras He proposed the idea that life exists everywhere With the scientific and Copernican revolutions and later during the Enlightenment cosmic pluralism became a mainstream notion supported by the likes of Giordano Bruno and Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle in his work Entretiens sur la pluralit des mondes Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as John Locke and astronomers such as William Herschel The astronomer Camille Flammarion promoted the notion of cosmic pluralism in his book La pluralit des mondes habit s None of these notions of pluralism were based on any specific observation or scientific information Early modern period There was a dramatic shift in thinking initiated by the invention of the telescope and the Copernican assault on geocentric cosmology Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community The best known early modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno who argued in the th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own planetary system Bruno wrote that other worlds have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth and like Earth contain animals and inhabitants Bruno s belief in the plurality of worlds was one of the charges leveled against him by the Venetian Holy Inquisition which trialed and executed him In the early th century the Czech astronomer Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita mused that if Jupiter has inhabitants they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth in proportion to the characteristics of the two spheres In Baroque literature such as The Other World The Societies and Governments of the Moon by Cyrano de Bergerac extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society The didactic poet Henry More took up the classical theme of the Greek Democritus in Democritus Platonissans or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds In The Creation a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books Sir Richard Blackmore observed We may pronounce each orb sustains a race Of living things adapted to the place With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought he suggested our world s sunne Becomes a starre elsewhere Fontanelle s Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds translated into English in offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life expanding rather than denying the creative sphere of a Maker The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated William Herschel the discoverer of Uranus was one of many th th century astronomers who believed that the Solar System is populated by alien life Other scholars of the period who championed cosmic pluralism included Immanuel Kant and Benjamin Franklin At the height of the Enlightenment even the Sun and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants th century Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late th century following telescopic observation of apparent Martian canals which soon however turned out to be optical illusions Despite this in American astronomer Percival Lowell published his book Mars followed by Mars and its Canals in proposing that the canals were the work of a long gone civilisation The idea of life on Mars led British writer H G Wells to write the novel The War of the Worlds in telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet s desiccation Spectroscopic analysis of Mars s atmosphere began in earnest in when U S astronomer William Wallace Campbell showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the Martian atmosphere By better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis As a consequence of the belief in the spontaneous generation there was little thought about the conditions of each celestial body it was simply assumed that life would thrive anywhere This theory was disproved by Louis Pasteur in the th century Popular belief in thriving alien civilisations elsewhere in the solar system still remained strong until Mariner and Mariner provided close images of Mars which debunked forever the idea of the existence of Martians and decreased the previous expectations of finding alien life in general The end of the spontaneous generation belief forced to investigate the origin of life Although abiogenesis is the more accepted theory a number of authors reclaimed the term panspermia and proposed that life was brought to Earth from elsewhere Some of those authors are J ns Jacob Berzelius Kelvin Hermann von Helmholtz and somewhat later by Svante Arrhenius The science fiction genre although not so named during the time developed during the late th century The expansion of the genre of extraterrestrials in fiction influenced the popular perception over the real life topic making people eager to jump to conclusions about the discovery of aliens Science marched at a slower pace some discoveries fueled expectations and others dashed excessive hopes For example with the advent of telescopes most structures seen on the Moon or Mars were immediately attributed to Selenites or Martians and later ones such as more powerful telescopes revealed that all such discoveries were natural features A famous case is the Cydonia region of Mars first imagined by the Viking orbiter The low resolution photos showed a rock formation that resembled a human face but later spacecraft took photos in higher detail that showed that there was nothing special about the site Recent history The search and study of extraterrestrial life became a science of its own Astrobiology Also known as exobiology this discipline is studied by the NASA the ESA the INAF and others Astrobiology studies life from Earth as well but with a cosmic perspective For example abiogenesis is of interest to astrobiology not because of the origin of life on Earth but for the chances of a similar process taking place in other celestial bodies Many aspects of life from its definition to its chemistry are analyzed as either likely to be similar in all forms of life across the cosmos or only native to Earth Astrobiology however remains constrained by the current lack of extraterrestrial lifeforms to study as all life on Earth comes from the same ancestor and it is hard to infer general characteristics from a group with a single example to analyse The th century came with great technological advances speculations about future hypothetical technologies and an increased basic knowledge of science by the general population thanks to science divulgation through the mass media The public interest in extraterrestrial life and the lack of discoveries by mainstream science led to the emergence of pseudosciences that provided affirmative if questionable answers to the existence of aliens Ufology claims that many unidentified flying objects UFOs would be spaceships from alien species and ancient astronauts hypothesis claim that aliens would have visited Earth in antiquity and prehistoric times but people would have failed to understand it by then Most UFOs or UFO sightings can be readily explained as sightings of Earth based aircraft including top secret aircraft known astronomical objects or weather phenomenons or as hoaxes The possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was ruled out in the s and during the s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbor highly developed life although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains open Many scientists are optimistic about the chances of finding alien life In the words of SETI s Frank Drake All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission At the same time the data returned by space probes and giant strides in detection methods have allowed science to begin delineating habitability criteria on other worlds and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful though aliens remain a question mark The Wow signal detected in by a SETI project remains a subject of speculative debate On the other hand other scientists are pessimistic Jacques Monod wrote that Man knows at last that he is alone in the indifferent immensity of the universe whence which he has emerged by chance In geologist and paleontologist Peter Ward and astrobiologist Donald Brownlee published a book entitled Rare Earth Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe In it they discussed the Rare Earth hypothesis in which they claim that Earth like life is rare in the universe whereas microbial life is common Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth like characteristics such as DNA and carbon As for the possible risks theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking warned in that humans should not try to contact alien life forms He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources If aliens visit us the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America which didn t turn out well for the Native Americans he said Jared Diamond had earlier expressed similar concerns On July Hawking and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner along with the SETI Institute announced a well funded effort called the Breakthrough Initiatives to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life The group contracted the services of the meter Robert C Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia in the United States and the meter Parkes Telescope in New South Wales Australia On February scientists including Geoffrey Marcy Seth Shostak Frank Drake and David Brin at a convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent extraterrestrials in the Cosmos was a good idea one result was a statement signed by many that a worldwide scientific political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent Government responses The Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Agreement define rules of planetary protection against potentially hazardous extraterrestrial life COSPAR also provides guidelines for planetary protection A committee of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs had in discussed for a year strategies for interacting with extraterrestrial life or intelligence The discussion ended without any conclusions As of the UN doesn t have response mechanisms for the case of an extraterrestrial contact One of the NASA divisions is the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance OSMA also known as the Planetary Protection Office A part of its mission is to rigorously preclude backward contamination of Earth by extraterrestrial life In Dmitry Rogozin the head of the Russian space agency said the search for extraterrestrial life is one of the main goals of deep space research He also acknowledged the possibility of existence of primitive life on other planets of the Solar System In the Chinese Government released a white paper detailing its space program According to the document one of the research objectives of the program is the search for extraterrestrial life It is also one of the objectives of the Chinese Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope FAST program The French space agency has an office for the study of non identified aero spatial phenomena The agency is maintaining a publicly accessible database of such phenomena with over detailed entries According to the head of the office the vast majority of entries have a mundane explanation but for of entries their extraterrestrial origin can neither be confirmed nor denied In chairman of the Israel Space Agency Isaac Ben Israel stated that the probability of detecting life in outer space is quite large But he disagrees with his former colleague Haim Eshed who stated that there are contacts between an advanced alien civilisation and some of Earth s governments See also Notes References
